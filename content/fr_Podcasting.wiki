== Qu'est-ce que le Podcasting? ==

Podcasting is distributing audio or video content via [[Glossary#RSS|RSS 2.0]], or  [[Glossary#Atom|Atom]]. Podcast clients such as [http://www.itunes.com/ iTunes], [http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/index.php Juice], or [http://www.castpodder.net/ CastPodder(linux)] allow listeners to subscribe to your RSS/Atom feed and automatically download your content to their portable audio players as it becomes available.

'''Comment ça marche'''

# Create audio or video that you want to share (usually MP3 or MP4)
# Upload the file to a server
# Link to the file in a post in your weblog
# Wordpress automatically Includes a link to the file in your RSS/Atom feed
# Listeners "subscribe" with podcast client application to your RSS/Atom feed and download new files automatically.

WordPress creates all the necessary links for you!

== Utiliser WordPress pour Faire du Podcasting ==

Podcasting is seamlessly supported as of Wordpress 1.5. Just link to an audio file in one of your posts and WordPress will automatically add the necessary enclosure tag to your RSS2 feed to make it useable as a podcast.

'''''Important:''' Use a complete, absolute URI when linking to the audio file.'' Otherwise WordPress will not make an enclosure for it.

 '''Wrong:''' &lt;a href="'''my-podcast.mp3'''">My podcast&lt;/a>
  
 '''Right:''' &lt;a href="'''<nowiki>http://example.com/my-podcast.mp3</nowiki>'''">My podcast&lt;/a>

That's it &mdash; just link to an audio file and WordPress takes care of everything for you.

Well, there is one more step: You need to make your RSS2 feed available. Be sureto put a link somewhere on your page:

 <nowiki>http://example.com/wordpress/?feed=rss2</nowiki>

Or, if you're using Atom:

 <nowiki>http://example.com/wordpress/?feed=atom</nowiki>

As of WordPress 1.5, the RSS 2.0/Atom links are located on the bottom of the page by default.

To make life easier for iTunes users, consider also linking to your podcast feed with the itpc:// protocol rather than http, e.g.:

 <nowiki>itpc://domain.org/path/?feed=atom</nowiki>

iTunes users will then be able  to subscribe to your feed with a single click.


'''Notes:'''

# As of WordPress 1.5, this '''only''' works for ''posts'' but not for static ''pages''.
# Make sure the linked file is accessible when you publish your post.  Otherwise, WordPress won't be able to collect the information it needs from the linked files.
# If you change a linked file, republish the post so WordPress can update its file size information about the file.
# Occasionally, you may have to put .xml at the end of the RSS/Atom url, for it to properly work.
# To get Wordpress to recognize m4a and m4b files as podcasts, you need to make sure that your web server is configured to serve them with the right content-type. Do this by adding the following directives to your Apache configuration file or .htaccess file:

 <nowiki>AddType audio/x-m4a .m4a
AddType audio/x-m4b .m4b</nowiki>

==Podcasts dédiés==

To create a dedicated podcast feed:

# Create a category in the Admin > Manage > Categories panel for your audio files and call it something like "podcasts".
# Assign every post containing an audio link to your "podcasts" category.
# If your blog is at example.com, your podcast feed will automatically be available at:
 <nowiki>http://example.com/wordpress/?feed=rss2&category_name=podcasts</nowiki>

Add this to your .htaccess file to make a nice rewrite rule that points visitors directly to your podcasts (assumes you've categorised your podcasts as 'podcasts' as in the example above):

 <nowiki>#podcast rewrite
RewriteRule ^podcasts/?$ /yourWPsubdirectoryhere/index.php?category_name=podcasts [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^podcasts/feed/(atom|rss2)/?$ /yourWPsubdirectoryhere/index.php?feed=$1&category_name=podcasts [QSA,L]</nowiki>

Now, you can give your podcasts feed as  <nowiki>http://example.com/podcasts/feed/rss2</nowiki> for RSS2 format, or <nowiki>http://example.com/podcasts/feed/atom</nowiki> for Atom format. (If you don't know the difference between the two, give out the first, as RSS2 is generally a bit better supported).

==Solutions d'Archive.org==

Archive.org can be used to host podcast audio files but archive.org uses re-directs on the file paths it publishes - this confuses WordPress, and consequently, the Podcast publication fails (missing enclosure tag error).

To avoid this error, if you are hosting your audio files on archive.org, you need to add a Custom Field called "enclosure" and paste the full url for the mp3 file in the Value field.

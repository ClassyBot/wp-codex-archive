== Introduction ==
WordPress is fast, lightweight, and easy to use. To ensure it stays that way, the [[Core Team]] thinks carefully about adding functionality to the core WordPress code. Still, users often find the need to graft additional functionality into WordPress to meet their needs. This section of the Codex offers guidelines and references for anyone wishing to modify, extend, or contribute to WordPress.

== Description ==
Loads the plugin's translated strings.

This function is the same as [[Function_Reference/load_plugin_textdomain|load_plugin_textdomain]] however it is designed for the mu-plugins directory rather than its WordPress equivalent which is designed for the normal plugins directory.

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$domain|string|Unique identifier for retrieving translated strings.}}
{{Parameter|$mu_plugin_rel_path|string|Relative path to the location of the .mo files.|optional|false}}

== Return Values ==
; boolean : Returns true if the language file was loaded successfully. Returns false, if the language file could not be loaded (it is not readable or the mo file reader can not understand it).

== Usage ==
%%%<?php load_muplugin_textdomain($domain, $mu_plugin_rel_path); ?>%%%

== Examples ==
This example assumes that the plugin's .mo files are placed in a 'lang' folder in your plugin's directory.  If the locale is set to 'es_US', WordPress will attempt to load 'my-plugin-es_US.mo' from the 'lang' directory.

<pre>add_action( 'plugins_loaded', 'myplugin_muload_textdomain' );
function myplugin_muload_textdomain() {
	load_muplugin_textdomain( 'my-plugin', basename( dirname(__FILE__) ) . '/lang' );
}
</pre>

== Change Log ==

* Since: [[Version 3.0|3.0.0]]

== Source File ==

<tt>load_muplugin_textdomain()</tt> is located in {{Trac|wp-includes/l10n.php}}.

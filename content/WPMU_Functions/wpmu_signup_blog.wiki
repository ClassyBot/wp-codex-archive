== Description ==
Stores the new user and blog details in the database and calls [[WPMU Functions/wpmu_signup_blog_notification|wpmu_signup_blog_notification]] to email the new user an activation link.

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$domain|string|Domain of the new blog (see explanation below).}}
{{Parameter|$path|string|Path of the new blog (see explanation below).}}
{{Parameter|$title|string|Title of the new blog.}}
{{Parameter|$user|string|New user's username.}}
{{Parameter|$user_email|string|New user's email address.}}
{{Parameter|$meta|object|Other meta information.|optional|[blank string]}}

=== $domain and $path ===
To help clarify the purpose of $domain and $path, in the activation email their are used as so...

http://$domain/$path

I suspect this this helps make the code more generic as there are three possible ways to setup WordPress MU that I am aware of...
*Sub-domains - http://blog.domain.com/
*Sub-folders - http://domain.com/blog
*Top level domains <i>(using sunrise)</i> e.g. http://domain.com

== Return Values ==
; <tt>(null)</tt>

== Usage ==
%%%<?php wpmu_signup_blog($domain, $path, $title, $user, $user_email, $meta); ?>%%%
== Family ==
===Sibling===
[[WPMU Functions/wpmu_signup_user|wpmu_signup_user]] does the same thing except that it only stores the new user details as is called when the user does not signup for a blog at the same time.

=== Children ===
[[WPMU Functions/wpmu_signup_blog_notification|wpmu_signup_blog_notification]] sends an activation email to new users after they have completed the signup process, it includes their activation link.

== Description ==
Returns an object containing various information relating to the current '''network'''.

'''Note''': <tt>get_current_site()</tt> was inherited from MU, and is named based on the old terminology which spoke of multiple "blogs" on a "site". We now speak of multiple "sites" on a "network" instead, but some of the old terminology still lives on in some function names. This function returns information about the current ''network''. To get information about the current site on the network, see <tt>[[Function_Reference/get_current_blog_id | get_current_blog_id()]]</tt> and <tt>[[Function_Reference/get_blog_details | get_blog_details()]]</tt>.

== Usage ==
%%%<?php get_current_site(); ?>%%%

== Parameters ==
None.

== Return Values ==

:; domain : <tt>(string)</tt> Domain of the site currently being viewed.
:; path : <tt>(string)</tt> Path of the site currently being viewed.
:; site_name : <tt>(string)</tt> Title of the site currently being viewed.

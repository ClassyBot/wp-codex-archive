== Description ==

Restores previous blog after a [[WPMU Functions/switch_to_blog|switch_to_blog]] call.

Contrary to the function's name, this does NOT restore the original blog but the previous blog. Calling `switch_to_blog()` twice in a row and then calling this function will result in being on the blog set by the first `switch_to_blog()` call.

== Parameters ==

None

== Return Values ==
; <tt>(boolean)</tt> : True if blog was restored, false if If you had never called [[WPMU Functions/switch_to_blog|switch_to_blog]].
; <tt>(global)</tt> : Sets up a global variable called: switched.

== Usage ==

%%%<?php restore_current_blog(); ?>%%%

== Examples ==

%%%<?php
    global $switched;
    switch_to_blog(7);
    echo 'You switched from blog ' . $switched . ' to 7';
    restore_current_blog();
    echo 'You switched back.';
?>%%%

== Related Functions ==

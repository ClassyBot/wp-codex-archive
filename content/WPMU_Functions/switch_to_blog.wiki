Note: If you're using WordPress Multisite, you can instead use [[Function Reference/switch_to_blog|switch_to_blog()]]
== Description ==
Switches the active blog until the user calls the restore_current_blog() function. This function is useful if you need to pull posts, or other information, from other blogs, you can then switch back after using restore_current_blog(). Using this function will <strong>not</strong> load plugins that only run on the blog you switch to.

This switch is to be used for internal and admin area functions. It's too expensive a query to run on the front end.

== Parameters ==

{{Parameter|$new_blog|integer|The id of the blog you want to switch to.}}

== Return Values ==
; <tt>(boolean)</tt> : True on success, false if new_blog was blank, or if you tried to switch to the blog you're on.
; <tt>(global)</tt> : Sets up a global variable called: switched.

== Usage ==

%%%<?php switch_to_blog($new_blog) ?>%%%

== Examples ==

%%%<?php
    /* 
       for global variables, since it is being changed or updated from time to time,
       please refer to Related Resources for more information
    */
    global $switched;
    switch_to_blog(7);
    echo 'You switched from blog ' . $switched . ' to 7';
    restore_current_blog();
    echo 'You switched back.';
?>%%%

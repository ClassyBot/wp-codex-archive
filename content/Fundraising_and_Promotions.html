<p>The following is a copy of the first email sent out to those on the list who signed up, starting the project.
</p>
<blockquote>Welcome to the first email of the new WordPress Fundraising and Promotions team. We will soon have enough people for our own official mailing list. Here is some basic information on what it means to be a member of the WordPress PR team.<br /><br />
<p>1) To promote WordPress events and activities.<br />
2) To coordinate WordPress events and activities but not necessarily run them, just make sure they don't overlap, conflict, or get "out of control".<br />
3) Report to Matt Mullenweg and the WordPress "administrators" in the weekly WordPress Meetup <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups" title="IRC Meetups">IRC_Meetups</a>.<br /><br />
Our specific duties will be to help write up press releases, contact the media, coordinate and support WordPress events and activities, maintain a calendar of events, and come up with the ideas that help promote WordPress products, events, and activities.<br /><br />
As a young organization, WordPress is just getting started to move towards a serious non-profit volunteer organization. The developers have been working together for a while and they seem to have a rhythm, and
the Codex <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Documentation_team" title="Documentation team">Documentation team</a> has been slowly evolving over the past few months. The <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Support_Forum_Volunteers" title="Support Forum Volunteers">Support Forum Volunteers</a> are just getting organized, and now the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/IRC" title="IRC">IRC</a> #wordpress chat group is starting to have a voice. As the Fundraising and Promotions team, it's our job to help connect the different groups, activities, and events around WordPress, in a way, like a liaison.  It's not just about the ideas, but helping the ideas take form and grow into a successful project.<br /><br />
We will have great successes and great failures, but this is an ongoing project that requires tender love and care handling to help WordPress develop and grow and, most importantly, remain FREE to the public.<br /><br />
The first project at hand is the WordPress Backup Week.  Information was just sent out to you all.  More information can be found at:  <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Backups" title="WordPress Backups">WordPress_Backups</a>. I'll include specifics in the next email.<br /><br />
We have a lot of projects that need some handholding over the next six months.  With new patches coming out, anticipation about v1.6, fundraising events, and volunteer recruitment, there is a lot of work to be done.<br /><br />
What I'd like to start us out with is a discussion on how to coordinate this mailing list, what you feel your responsibilities/talents are and how you can help.  Ideas for promotions are great, but for now, let's focus on some
structure.  Currently, there is no structure and I'd like to see some established, so we need to know what each of us can do and is willing to do.<br /><br />
Thanks again and I hope we can all work together to help WordPress continue to grow.<br /><br />

<p>The following is just a casual list of the specific responsibilities and positions that will be needed as the Fundraising and Promotions Team develops. Grunt work at all levels will be required, but these are the leadership roles that may need filling by more than one person working with the team. Specific events will have specific leaders and coordinators, but this is for the day-to-day activities and tasks.
</p>
<dl><dt>Reviewer Catcher&#160;</dt>
<dd>Volunteer to monitor and "catch" all reviews of WordPress and add them to the list with quotes and links.  Will also maintain contact list of reviewers and contact reviewers when new versions/updates are released.</dd>
<dt>Quote Catcher&#160;</dt>
<dd>While this can be done by everyone, we need someone to coordinate and maintain the list of quotes and references about WordPress for reference in <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Fundraising_and_Promotions/Statements" title="Fundraising and Promotions/Statements">statements</a>.</dd>
<dt>Media List Maintainer&#160;</dt>
<dd>The <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Fundraising_and_Promotions/Media_List" title="Fundraising and Promotions/Media List">Fundraising and Promotions/Media List</a> is currently under development and we need someone to help to maintain and update the list.</dd></dl>

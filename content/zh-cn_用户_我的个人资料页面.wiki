==您的个人资料和设置==
The only pieces of information WordPress requires you to include in your Profile are your '''e-mail address''' and a '''nickname'''.  It should be noted that WordPress requires your email address only for your blog's administration purposes.  The email address is never sent to any other site (not even to the people at WordPress headquarters), and it is never displayed on your site (unless you put it there manually).  Only the other ''registered'' users of your blog have access to the e-mail address you provide.  Also, remember that each user's email address must be unique.

'''Note''':  it is ''possible'' for a theme to display your e-mail address (and the e-mail addresses of your other registered users) on your site, since the [[Template Tags/the_author_meta|<code>the_author_meta('user_email')</code>]] template tag can be used for such purposes.  This would be a poorly conceived theme, however, if it didn't inform you of that before you downloaded it.  Neither of the themes included with WordPress display any e-mail address anywhere on your site by default.  

All of the other personal information asked for here is ''optional'', and, again, it is never sent to any other site or person.  It ''may'' be displayed on your site, however, depending on the theme you use, so you should test things out with your particular theme if you're at all paranoid (and a bit of paranoia regarding your personal information is healthy).  See [[Function Reference/the_author|the_author]] and related template tags for information on how to display this information on your site (and, consequently, how to ensure the theme you use does/does not display any of this information).  Typically, themes only display the information you enter in the '''Display name publicly as''' field.

:*'''First name''' - Enter your first name in this text box.
:*'''Last name''' -  Enter your last name in this text box. 
:*'''Nickname''' - Enter the nickname as it is a required for every user.  It may be the same as your '''User Name''' or it can be different.  If you don’t supply a Nickname, then the '''User Name'''  will be placed in this field.  
:*'''Display name publicly as''' -  Select, from the drop-down, how your name is cited on your blog.  You can choose from several of the above pieces of information:  '''Nickname''', '''Login''' name, '''First Name''', '''Last Name''', "'''First Last'''", or "'''Last First'''".  If you prefer "'''Last, First'''", insert a comma after your last name in the '''Last Name''' text box above and choose the last option from this dropdown.

;Contact Info :
:*'''E-mail''' - All users are required to list an e-mail address in their respective Profiles.  The E-mail address must be unique for each user.  Your blog will use this address to notify you of new comments to your posts and for other administrative purposes.  To reiterate what was said above, only other registered users of your blog will have access to this e-mail address.  It is ''never'' sent anywhere.
:*'''Website''' - Enter your website address.  
:*'''AIM''' - Enter your [http://www.aim.com/ AIM] screen name here.  For information on how to display this on your site, see the [[Template Tags/the_author_meta|<code>the_author_meta('aim')</code>]] template tag.
:*'''Yahoo IM''' - Enter your [http://messenger.yahoo.com/ Yahoo Messenger] ID here.  For information on how to display this on your site, see the [[Template Tags/the_author_meta|<code>the_author_meta('yim')</code>]] template tag.
:*<span id="Identity_on_blog">'''Jabber / Google Talk'''</span> - Enter your [http://www.google.com/talk/ Jabber / Google Talk] name here.  For information on how to display this on your site, see the example in the [[Author Templates#About Current Author|Author Templates]] article.

;About Yourself :
:*'''Biographical Info''' - Enter a short description or profile of yourself here.  This optional information can be displayed by your theme if so configured by the theme author.  See [[Template Tags/the_author_meta|<code>the_author_meta('description')</code>]] template tag.
:*'''New Password''' - Enter your password twice, once in each of the two text boxes.  Leaving these text boxes blank will keep the password you are currently using.  
:: '''Strength Indicator'''  This indicates if the password you entered is Very Weak, Weak, Medium, or Strong (displayed in green).  The stronger the password the more secure your login.  Hint: The password should be at least seven characters long. To make it stronger, use upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols like ''!"?$%^&)''.

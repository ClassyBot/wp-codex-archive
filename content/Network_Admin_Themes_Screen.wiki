===Table of Themes===

This table lists all of your installed Themes by row. Themes are displayed alphabetically by the folder name used for storing that theme in the <tt>wp-contents/themes</tt> folder.

The table of themes contains the following columns:

*'''Theme''' – The name of the theme as defined by the theme author. Under the Theme name, you can select following action:
**'''Network Enable'''/'''Network Disable''' - This is toggle action. The Theme that has Network Enable link is not yet enabled in the network. Click this link so that Site Administrators can see this Theme from [[Administration Screens|Administration]] > [[Administration Screens#Appearance|Appearance]] > [[Appearance Themes Screen|Themes]] Screen. Click Network Disable link to hide this theme from above [[Administration Screens#Appearance|Appearance]] > [[Appearance Themes Screen|Themes]] Screen. 
**'''Edit''' - Click to edit Theme's [[Templates|Template]] or [[CSS|Stylesheet]] files with Theme Editor. For more detail about Theme Editor, refer [[Appearance Editor Screen]] article.
**'''Delete''' - Delete the Theme.
*'''Description''' - A description of the theme as described by the theme author with the Theme version, Theme author and link to the Theme Site.


==Add New Theme==

Visit the [[Appearance Themes Screen#Install_Themes|Add Themes]] Screen to install new Theme by clicking Add New link at the top of this [[Network Admin Themes Screen]] or Select '''[[Network Admin]] > [[Network Admin#Themes|Themes]] > [[#Add_New|Add New]]''' from left side menu.

For more detail about installing Themes, refer [[Appearance Themes Screen#Install_Themes|Install Themes]] article.


==Theme Editor==

The built-in Theme Editor allows you to view or change any code kept in a Theme [[Templates|Template]] or [[CSS|Stylesheet]] files. Select [[Network Admin]] > [[Network Admin#Themes|Themes]] > [[#Theme_Editor|Edit]] and select Theme from Select theme to edit box and click Select button, or Click Edit link under the Theme from this [[Network Admin Themes Screen]].

For more detail about Theme Editor, refer [[Appearance Editor Screen]] article.


==Default Theme==

When new sites are created via [[Network Admin|Administration]] > [[Network Admin#Sites|Network Admin]] > [[Network Admin Sites Screen|Sites]], the {{DefaultTheme}} will be set as the active (default) theme.  If a different active (default) theme is desired, edit the [[Editing wp-config.php|wp-config.php]] and add the WP_DEFAULT_THEME constant definition to the file.  For example to make the WordPress Classic Theme the default theme put this in [[Editing wp-config.php|wp-config.php]]:

 define('WP_DEFAULT_THEME', 'classic');

If you do remove the {{DefaultTheme}} then you need to define a new default theme with the '''WP_DEFAULT_THEME''' constant.   

Disabling a theme in the [[Network Admin Themes Screen]] does not prevent that theme being used by a site. It only prevents the theme being listed in the available themes list when selecting a new/different theme.

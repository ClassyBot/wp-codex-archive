The Upgrade Networks feature will step through each site, five at a time, and make sure any database changes are applied.  This menu item is only visible if you are logged in as a Super Admin role user. You can access it from any site in the network.

If for any reason a site does not get upgraded, each site should be upgraded when the admin for that site logs in to the administration for that site.  Sites that have been deactivated will not be upgraded by this process, however, if a site is reactivated, the site will get upgraded when an admin for that site logs in to the dashboard for that site.

;Upgrade Network : Click this button to start the upgrade process. Clicking the Upgrade Network button will step through each site in the network, five at a time, and make sure any database updates are applied. 

If a version update to core has not happened, clicking this button won’t affect anything.

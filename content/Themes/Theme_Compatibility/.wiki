As WordPress makes changes and improvements, sometimes these impact WordPress Themes and their underlying code and use of [[Template Tags]]. When a new version is announced, WordPress users are recommended to check the various WordPress Theme Compatibility lists to ensure their WordPress Theme is updated and ready for the new version.

If you do not find your WordPress Theme listed, it may have been updated. Check with the WordPress Theme designer for the most recent updated version.

See also [[Plugins/Plugin_Compatibility/|WordPress Plugin Compatibilities]] listings for a list of Plugins that will work with the latest version of WordPress.

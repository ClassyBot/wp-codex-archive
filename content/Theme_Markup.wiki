'''Theme Markup''' is a [[Theme Features|theme feature]], first introduced in [[Version 3.6]]. This feature allows themes to explicitly choose to apply HTML5 markup for search forms, comment forms, comment lists, gallery and caption.

== Adding Theme Support ==

Since [[Version 3.6]], themes should use [[Function_Reference/add_theme_support|add_theme_support()]] in the [[Theme_Development#Functions_File|functions.php]] file in order to support theme markup, like so:

<pre>add_theme_support( 'html5', array( 'gallery' ) );</pre>

The second parameter accepts one or more values indicating which HTML5 features to support. Support for '<tt>search-form</tt>', '<tt>comment-form</tt>' and '<tt>comment-list</tt>' were added in [[Version 3.6]]. Support for '<tt>gallery</tt>' and '<tt>caption</tt>' were added in [[Version 3.9]].:

<pre>
$args = array(
	'search-form',
	'comment-form',
	'comment-list',
	'gallery',
	'caption',
);
add_theme_support( 'html5', $args );
</pre>

The second argument is a required parameter for forward compatibility reasons. Namely, so a theme won't break in newer versions of WordPress that have HTML5 features not supported by an older theme.

== Changelog ==

* [[Version 3.6|3.6]]: Introduced with '<tt>search-form</tt>', '<tt>comment-form</tt>' and '<tt>comment-list</tt>' support
* [[Version 3.9|3.9]]: Added '<tt>gallery</tt>' and '<tt>caption</tt>' support

== Notes ==

* '''Galleries & Captions:''' As of version 3.9 WordPress uses <code><figure></code> and <code><figcaption></code> elements, instead of the generic definition list markup to output [[The WordPress Gallery|galleries]]. More on this in the [http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/15/html5-galleries-captions-in-wordpress-3-9/ Make WordPress Core article].

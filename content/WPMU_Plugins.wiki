Not all WP plugins work with WPMU. See [[WPMU Plugin Compatibility]]. Plugin authors are working towards better compatibility.

There are some special WPMU Plugins. See the official plugin repository and the WPMU tag. http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/wpmu or http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/multisite

Please refer to each plugin's specific documentation. Plugins built specifically for WPMU may be required to be placed in the mu-plugins folder. 

These plugins are usually designed to work sitewide or to be available to Site Admins only.

==Write &rarr; Write Page==  

[[Pages]] are like posts but live outside of the normal blog chronology.  This means they will not be displayed with the rest of your posts; they can only be displayed individually.  This Write Page SubPanel allows you to create new pages and edit existing ones.

==Write Page Options==

The options here are the same as those listed for in the [[Write Post SubPanel]] with the following additions.

;Page Parent:  (located in the upper right) This option defaults to 'Main Page (no parent)', but can be set to any other already existing page to make the new page a 'subpage'.  Permalinks and page lists reflect this subpage status hierarchically.
;Page Template:  Any page can be assigned to use a different template than the one used for the rest of your blog.
;Page Order: You can specify the order of the pages that the [[Template Tags|Template Tag]] called [[Template Tags/wp_list_pages|wp_list_pages()]] displays when the tag is given the argument <code>sort_column=menu_order</code>.  You can specify integers from <code>0</code> to (almost) any arbitrarily high number.

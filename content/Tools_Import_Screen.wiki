Importing data into your WordPress blog is many times, necessary and useful.  If you are moving from another host, or just to start your blog anew, then import data into your blog may be the answer.  

Remember that [[Importing Content]] has explicit details about most of the import choices listed below.

; WordPress : Import posts, comments, custom fields, pages, and categories from a [[Tools Export Screen|WordPress export file]].

== Summary ==
  
From the [https://wordpress.org/news/2018/04/wordpress-4-9-5-security-and-maintenance-release/ WordPress 4.9.5 release post], WordPress versions 4.9.4 and earlier are affected by three security issues. As part of the core team's ongoing commitment to security hardening, the following fixes have been implemented:

<ol>
<li>Don't treat localhost as same host by default.</li>
<li>Use safe redirects when redirecting the login page if SSL is forced.</li>
<li>Make sure the version string is correctly escaped for use in generator tags.</li>
</ol>

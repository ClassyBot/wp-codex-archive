<p>The Table of Comments displays all the comments, with the most recent comment displayed first.  In the instructions that follow, reference is made to using a mouse to click on fields and links, but the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Keyboard_Shortcuts" title="Keyboard Shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</a> article describes the various keyboard combinations that will allow navigation and management of comments without using the mouse.
</p>
<ul><li><b>[ ]</b> – This checkbox, when clicked (checked), 'selects' that particular comment to be processed by a <a href="#Actions">Bulk Action</a>.</li>
<li><b>Gravatar</b> - This is a picture or <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Gravatar" title="Glossary">gravatar</a> of the comment author.  </li>
<li><b>Author</b> - This is the name of the comment author.  Below the comment author name is the comment author's email address that can be clicked to begin an email to that address.  Below the email address is the commenter’s web-site in the form of a URL that can be click to visit that commenter’s web-site.  Below the email address is commenter’s IP address in the form of a link.  Clicking that IP address link causes all the comments originated by that IP address to be displayed thus allowing a Bulk Action to be applied to all comments from that address.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The first item in this column is the comment date and time presented as a link.  Click the date and time will take you to that comment on your live site. Below the date and time is the actual comment that was submitted. Hovering over any comment gives you Immediate Actions that can be performed on that comment.</li>
<li><b>In Response To</b> - There are three elements. The text is the name of the post that inspired the comment, and links to the post editor for that entry. The View Post link leads to that post on your live site. The small bubble with the number in it shows the number of approved comments that post has received. If the bubble is gray, you have moderated all comments for that post. If it is blue, there are pending comments. Clicking the bubble will filter the comments screen to show only comments on that post.</li></ul>

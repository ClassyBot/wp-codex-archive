This page will be dedicated to the team that will care for the translations of WP and all related stuff.

We need to define targets, workflows and methods to use for future WP version and how to better coordinate the various translation teams and what infos should be coded here to help transaltors to get locale WP faster and easy.

Add you idea here please, discussion will be done later on [http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-polyglots wp-polyglots] mailing list

This short guide will show you how to:

* set a grid layout or a slider to display content on your homepage
* customize the *featured* tag to choose which posts you display on the homepage.

== Choose your Layout ==

You can either have a grid layout or a slider on the homepage. Here's how they look:

When you're done click '''Save and Publish'''.

To assign content to appear in the grid or slider, you should assign it the Featured tag. This will display your posts, displaying the featured image.

The next section will show you how to customize the Featured tag.

== Change the Featured Tag ==

By default, Twenty Fourteen displays any post in the slider or grid with the tag "Featured" attached to it. If no posts have this tag, a sticky post is displayed instead.

You can edit this tag in the Theme Customizer. To edited the tag, go to '''Appearance > Customizer'''. Under the '''Featured Content''' section, change the name of the tag.

The '''Don't display this tag on the front end''' checkbox lets you determine whether you want the Featured tag to appear in tag clouds on the front end.

Save and publish.

== What else? ==

You can also use the Theme Customizer to make the following changes to your website:

* Change your Custom Header image
* Featured Images; works best with images that are least 1038 wide
* Change the background image or color
* Choose which navigation menus should appear (Twenty Fourteen supports two menus — one in the sidebar and one in the header)
* Set a static front page

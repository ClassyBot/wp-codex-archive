<p>In very early versions of WordPress, the only way to modify the behavior of WordPress was through a "hack", i.e. by modifying the core files of WordPress. However, since version 1.5, WordPress has offered both <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins" title="Plugins">plugin</a> and <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes" title="Using Themes">theme</a> capabilities as mechanisms to modify nearly everything that WordPress does, from looks to functionality, so hacks are seldom necessary any more, and certainly not recommended.
</p><p><b>Since at least version 2.8, my-hacks.php file is not supported any longer.</b>
</p><p><span style="color:red"><b>Hacks are not officially supported by WordPress.  Use at your own risk.</b></span>

<p>Although hacks are not recommended, and since version 1.5 of WordPress, seldom necessary, for completeness, this article still documents the <tt>my-hacks.php</tt> file, which you can enable and use for "hacks".  Basically, you can put PHP functions and variable definitions into this file (which goes into your root WordPress installation directory), and if you activate it, it will be loaded just before plugins when WordPress starts up. 
</p><p>To activate <tt>my-hacks.php</tt>:
</p>
<ul><li> In the Administration Panel, choose <b>Options &gt; Miscellaneous</b>. </li>
<li> At the bottom of the page, click the check box for <b><tt>Use legacy my-hacks.php file support</tt></b> to put a check in it.</li>
<li> Click Update to save the changed option.</li></ul>

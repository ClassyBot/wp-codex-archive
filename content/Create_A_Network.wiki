WordPress includes the ability to create a [[Glossary#Network|network]] of [[Glossary#Site|sites]] by using the [[Glossary#Multisite|multisite]] feature. This article contains instructions for creating a multisite network.

A multisite network can be very similar to your own personal version of WordPress.com. End users of your network can create their own sites on demand, just like end users of WordPress.com can create blogs on demand. If you do not have any need to allow end users to create their own sites on demand, you can create a multisite network in which only you, the administrator, can add new sites.

A multisite network is a collection of sites that all share the same WordPress installation. They can also share plugins and themes. The individual sites in the network are ''virtual'' sites in the sense that they do not have their own directories on your server, although they do have separate directories for media uploads within the shared installation, and they do have separate tables in the database.

== Before You Begin ==

__TOC__

Compared with a typical single WordPress installation a network installation has additional considerations. You must decide if you want to use subdomains or subdirectories and how you want to manage them. Installing themes and plugins is different: for example, each individual site of a network can activate both, but install neither.

This guide describes how to install manually WordPress Multisite in your current WordPress installation.

<strong>Please read [[Before You Create A Network]] in full before continuing.</strong>

== Prepare Your WordPress ==

Your existing WordPress site will be updated when creating a network. Unless this is a fresh install and you have nothing to lose, please [[WordPress Backups|backup your database and files]].


Also deactivate all active plugins. You can reactivate them again after the network is created.

If you plan to [[Giving WordPress Its Own Directory|run WordPress out of its own directory]], do that <em>before</em> activating Multisite.

== Allow Multisite ==

To enable the Network Setup menu item, you must first enable multisite in the [[Editing wp-config.php|<code>wp-config.php</code>]] file.

Open up <code>wp-config.php</code> and add this line '''above''' where it says <code>/* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */</code>. If it doesn't say that anywhere, then add the line somewhere above the first line that begins with <code>require</code> or <code>include</code>:

 /* Multisite */
 define( 'WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true );

You will need to refresh your browser to continue.

== Installing a Network ==
The previous step enables the '''Network Setup''' item in your '''Tools menu'''. Use that menu item to go to the '''Network Setup''' screen.

[[Image:network-create.png|thumb|Tools Network Screen]]

To see an example of the Create a Network of WordPress Sites screen, look at [[Administration Screens|Administration]] > [[Administration Screens#Tools|Tools]] > [[Tools Network Screen|Network Setup]]. The screen does not look exactly the same in all circumstances. The example shown is for an installation on <code>localhost</code>, which restricts the options available.

'''Addresses of Sites in your Network'''

You are given the choice between subdomains and subdirectories. Except when one is restricted by [[Before_You_Create_A_Network#WordPress_Settings_Requirements|existing settings]] and restricts one's options.

Follow your DNS & Web Server settings to configure subdomains and install an SSL certificate for each subdomain and master domain. They can both be on the same IP address if your web server accepts '''Server Name Indication'''. Add '''HSTS''' to primary domain and the parameter to include subdomains if you are not going to use folders.

Once more: See [http://codex.wordpress.org/Before_You_Create_A_Network Before You Create A Network].

:* '''Subdomains''' &mdash; a domain-based network in which on-demand sites use subdomains
:* '''Subdirectories''' &mdash; a path-based network in which on-demand sites use paths

'''Network Details'''

These are filled in automatically, but you can make changes.
:; Server Address
:: The domain of the URL you are using to access your WordPress installation.
:; Network Title 	
:: The title of your network as a whole.
:; Admin Email Address
:: Your email address as super admin of the network as a whole.

Double-check the details and press the '''Install''' button.

'''Note:''' The installer may perform a check for wildcard subdomains when you have not configured them yet, or when you do not need them at all. Ignore the warning if it does not apply to your network. See the [http://codex.wordpress.org/Before_You_Create_A_Network#Server_Requirements Server Requirements] section in [[Before You Create A Network]] for information about wildcard subdomains.

== Enabling the Network ==
[[Image:tools-network-created.png|thumb|Tools Network Created]]

To enable your network, follow the instructions on the Create a Network of WordPress Sites screen. The instructions that you see are customized for your installation. They might not be the same as the examples you see here.

Back up your existing <code>wp-config.php</code> and <code>.htaccess</code> files, unless this is a fresh install and you have nothing to lose.

There are two steps:

;1. Add the specified lines to your [[Editing wp-config.php|<code>wp-config.php</code> file]]
: The extra lines go just after where you added the line in [[#Step 2: Allow Multisite|Step 2: Allow Multisite]].

;2. Add the specified lines to your <code>.htaccess</code> file
: If you do not have a <code>.htaccess</code> file, then create it in the same directory as your <code>wp-config.php</code> file.
:If you <em>ALREADY</em> have a <code>.htaccess</code> file, replace any existing WP lines with these new ones.
: In some cases you might also have to add Options FollowSymlinks at the start of the file.

After completing these steps, log in again using the link provided.

== Network Admin Settings ==

[[Image:network-admin-link.png|left|Network Admin]]

In your WordPress toolbar, <b>My Sites</b> is now the second item. There, all your sites are listed, with handy fly-out menus, as well as a '''Network Admin''' menu item. Under '''Network Admin''' you can use the '''Dashboard''' item to go to the Network Dashboard screen.

Go to the [[Network Admin#Settings|Settings Screen]] to configure network options, and the [[Network Admin#Sites|Sites Screen]] to manage your sites.

For more information, see: [[Network Admin]]

== Administration ==

There are some additional things you might need to know about advanced administration of the network, due to the additional complexity of a Multisite. Even if you're familiar with WordPress, the location and behavior of Multisite Network Administration has several major differences from a regular single site installation.

Read [[Multisite Network Administration]] for more information.

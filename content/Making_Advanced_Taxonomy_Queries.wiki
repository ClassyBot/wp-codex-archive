==Description==
This article covers the topic of performing advanced taxonomy-centric queries (such as categories, tags, or custom taxonomies).

Making advanced post queries in WordPress is [[Function_Reference/query_posts|very well documented]], but plugin and theme developers may find that they need to leverage WordPress's taxonomy system with the same level of flexibility as the post system.

==Prerequisites & Assumptions==
This article assumes that you are already very familiar with making MySQL queries both in and out of WordPress. You should also be very familiar with WordPress's [[Class Reference/wpdb|$wpdb class object]] and its various methods.

==Built-in WordPress Helper Functions==
This article is about making very advanced queries. Keep in mind that WordPress contains a large number of helper functions for making ''simple'' taxonomy and term queries. Please see if these functions meet your needs before continuing on with this article...

* [[Function_Reference/get_taxonomies|get_taxonomies()]] - Can be used to fetch all or some registered taxonomies
* [[Function_Reference/get_the_terms|get_the_terms()]] - Fetch all terms for a single, specific taxonomy
* [[Function_Reference/get_terms|get_terms()]] - Fetch all terms for a one ''or more'' taxonomies

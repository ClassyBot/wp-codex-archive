==Media &rarr; Library==

Media consists of the images, video, recordings, and files that you upload and use in your blog.  Media is typically uploaded and inserted into the content when [[Posts Add New Screen|writing a Post]] or [[Pages Add New Screen|writing a Page]].  Note that the Uploading Setting in the [[Settings Media Screen]] describes the location and structure of the upload directory (where your media files are stored).  If you do need to upload Media, even if that Media is not related to a Post or Page, then you need to use the [[Media Add New Screen]].

Visit the [[Media Add New Screen]] to install new media by clicking Add New link at the top of this screen or Select '''[[Administration Panels#Media|Media]] > [[Media Add New Screen|Add New]]''' from left side menu.

===Media Library===

The [[Media Library Screen]] allows you to edit, view, and delete Media previously uploaded to your blog.  Multiple Media objects can be selected for deletion.  Search and filtering ability is also provided to allow you to find the desired Media.  

Media Library provides two type of views. One is simple visual [[#Media_Library_Grid_View"|Grid View]] and another is conventional [[#Media_Library_List_View"|List View]]. Switch between these views using the icons to the left above the screen.

== Summary ==

From the [https://wordpress.org/news/2018/04/wordpress-4-9-5-security-and-maintenance-release/ WordPress 4.9.5 release post]: This maintenance release fixes 28 bugs in 4.9, including fixes for Customizer, media library, error notices, and some security fixes.
Twenty Seventeen bundled theme and Hello Dolly bundled plugin have also been updated.

WordPress versions 4.9.4 and earlier are affected by three security issues. As part of the core team’s ongoing commitment to security hardening, the following fixes have been implemented in 4.9.5:

* Switch to `wp_safe_redirect()` when redirecting the login page when SSL is forced
* Escape HTML returned from `get_the_generator()`
* Disallow localhost in `wp_http_validate_url()`

Thank you to the reporters of these issues for practicing responsible security disclosure: xknown, Nitin Venkatesh (nitstorm), and Garth Mortensen.

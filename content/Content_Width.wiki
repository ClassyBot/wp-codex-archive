'''Content Width''' is a [[Theme Features|theme feature]], first introduced in [[Version 2.6]]. Using this feature you can set the maximum allowed width for any content in the theme, like [[oEmbed]]s and images added to posts.

Using this theme feature, WordPress can scale oEmbed code to a specific size (width) in the front-end, and insert large images without breaking the main content area. 

== Adding Theme Support ==

Since [[Version 2.6]], themes need to specify the <tt>$content_width</tt> variable in the [[Theme_Development#Functions_File|functions.php]] file, like so:

<pre>
if ( ! isset( $content_width ) ) {
	$content_width = 600;
}
</pre>

It's also recommended to add the following CSS to your theme:

<pre>
.size-auto, 
.size-full,
.size-large,
.size-medium,
.size-thumbnail {
	max-width: 100%;
	height: auto;
}
</pre>
<b>Notes:</b>
This variable is also used when displaying a pop-up selection in the Media Editor. If you have used the global $_wp_additional_image_sizes to allow a pop-up of your custom image sizes defined using [[Function Reference/add_image_size|add_image_size()]] then the $content_width will override the width specified by your <tt>add_image_size()</tt> function.
(The array $_wp_additional_image_sizes is covered in [[Function Reference/get_intermediate_image_sizes|get_intermediate_image_sizes()]] and basically holds the name/height/width of your various image sizes available.)

<b>Example:</b> Suppose you define a 640x320 image using 
<pre>add_image_size( 'full-width-horizontal', 640, 320,true );</pre>
If you have set your $content width to 600 for some reason
<pre>$content_width = 600;</pre>
then you also add your size to the media pop-up using [http://kucrut.org/insert-image-with-custom-size-into-post/ this example by kucrut] the result will be a pop-up that shows <br />
"Full width horizontal - <b>600</b> x 300" <br />rather than the expected<br />"Full width horizontal - <b>640</b> x 320"

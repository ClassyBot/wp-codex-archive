==Network Admin &rarr; Themes==

The [[Network Admin Themes Screen]] controls which themes are available to Site administrators in their [[Administration Screens|Administration]] > [[Administration Screens#Appearance|Appearance]] > [[Appearance Themes Screen|Themes]] Screen.  Network Administrators must install the themes in the wp-content/themes folder for the themes to be available.  Themes can also be selectively activated for individual Sites in the Theme Info section when Editing a site via [[Network Admin|Administration]] > [[Network Admin#Sites|Network Admin]] > [[Network Admin Sites Screen|Sites]].

===Table of Themes===
This table lists all of your categories by row.  Categories are displayed hierarchically and alphabetically by the folder name used for storing that theme in the <tt>wp-contents/themes</tt> folder.  

The table of themes contains the following columns:

*'''Enable''' - Whether this theme is enabled for use by Site Administrators.  Radio buttons of Yes or No.  Set to Yes to make the available to Site administrators in their [[Administration Screens|Administration]] > [[Administration Screens#Appearance|Appearance]] > [[Appearance Themes Screen|Themes]] Screen.
*'''Theme''' â€“ The name of the theme as defined by the theme author.
*'''Version''' - The current version of the theme as defined by the theme author.
*'''Description''' - A description of the theme as described by the theme author.

;Total:  Themes installed and themes enabled.

===Apply Changes===
:Click the '''Apply Changes''' button to ensure any changes you have made to your Settings are saved to your database.  Once you click the button, a confirmation text box will appear at the top of the page telling you your settings have been saved.

==Default Theme==

When new sites are created via [[Network Admin|Administration]] > [[Network Admin#Sites|Network Admin]] > [[Network Admin Sites Screen|Sites]], the {{DefaultTheme}} will be set as the active (default) theme.  If a different active (default) theme is desired, edit the [[Editing wp-config.php|wp-config.php]] and add the WP_DEFAULT_THEME constant definition to the file.  For example to make the WordPress Classic Theme the default theme put this in [[Editing wp-config.php|wp-config.php]]:

 define('WP_DEFAULT_THEME', 'classic');

If you do remove the {{DefaultTheme}} then you need to define a new default theme with the '''WP_DEFAULT_THEME''' constant.   Disabling a theme in the [[Network Admin Themes Screen]] does not prevent that theme being used by a site. It only prevents the theme being listed in the available themes list when selecting a new/different theme.

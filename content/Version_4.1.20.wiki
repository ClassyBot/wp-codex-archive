== Summary ==

From the [https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-8-3-security-release/ WordPress 4.8.3 release post]: WordPress versions 4.8.2 and earlier are affected by an issue where <code>$wpdb->prepare()</code> can create unexpected and unsafe queries leading to potential SQL injection (SQLi). WordPress core is not directly vulnerable to this issue, but weâ€™ve added hardening to prevent plugins and themes from accidentally causing a vulnerability. Reported by [https://twitter.com/ircmaxell Anthony Ferrara].

This release includes a change in behaviour for the <code>esc_sql()</code> function. Most developers will not be affected by this change, you can read more details in the [https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/31/changed-behaviour-of-esc_sql-in-wordpress-4-8-3/ developer note].

From the [https://wordpress.org/news/2018/01/wordpress-4-9-2-security-and-maintenance-release/ WordPress 4.9.2 release post]: WordPress versions 4.9 and earlier are affected by an XSS vulnerability in the Flash fallback files in MediaElement 4.x. The following fixes have been implemented in this release:

<li>External Libraries: Remove unnecessary / obsoleted MediaElement.js files. ([https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42720 #42720])</li>

<p><b>Has anyone heard of a hack to stop users from getting a blog automatically when they are created?</b>
</p><p>See the <a href="/index.php?title=WPMU_Admin_Confirmed_Username_Before_Able_To_Blog&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="WPMU Admin Confirmed Username Before Able To Blog (page does not exist)">WPMU Admin Confirmed Username Before Able To Blog</a> hack
</p><p>On small setups, you may wish to hack the signup process to moderation. In this hack, the activation email goes to the site admin and not the user. The site admin can then choose to activate the blog or not.

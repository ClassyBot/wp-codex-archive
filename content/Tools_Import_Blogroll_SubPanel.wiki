==Import your blogroll from another system==

This import tool uses an OPML file from a link manager service such as [http://www.blogrolling.com/ BlogRolling] or [http://blo.gs/ Blo.gs] and others.

'''OPML''' (Outline Processor Markup Language) is an XML-based format for transferring information in an environment-independent form. For more information, see the [http://www.opml.org/ Outline Processor Markup Language Organizaion].

Choose from either option 1 or 2 to add your blogroll.  Follow the instructions provided:

# Go to [http://www.blogrolling.com/ Blogrolling.com] and sign in. Once you’ve done that, click on Get Code, and then look for the OPML code.
# Or go to [http://blo.gs/ Blo.gs] and sign in. Once you’ve done that in the 'Welcome Back' box on the right, click on share, and then look for the OPML link (<tt>favorites.opml</tt>).
# Select that text and copy it or copy the link/shortcut into the box below.<br /><br /><span style="border:1px solid #003366; margin:20px; padding: 5px">Specify an OPML URL: '''Enter the OPML address'''</span><br /><br />
#  or you can upload an OPML file from your desktop :<br /><br /><span style="border:1px solid #003366; margin:20px; padding: 5px">Or choose from your local disk: '''Click Browse to select the file on your local disk:'''</span><br /><br />
# Now select a [[Links Link Categories SubPanel|Link Category]] you want to put these links in.
# Click '''Import OPML File''' and the file will be imported.

If you use another service that isn't on there, do the similar actions with that service to create an OPML file.  If you don't know how, check with your blogroll service.

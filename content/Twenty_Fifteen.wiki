There are a few ways that you can customize Twenty Fifteen, all from WordPress' Customizer. This short guide will show you how to:

* choose a featured color scheme
* add descriptions to your menus
* add social icons in your menu

== Choose a Featured Color Scheme ==

Twenty Fifteen has six color schemes you can use to change the look of your blog. The Default color scheme is a light gray, but you can also choose from Dark, Yellow, Pink, Purple, and Blue.

When you're done, click '''Save Menu'''.

== Add Social Icons ==

Twenty Fifteen also allows you to display links to your social media profiles with crisp, perfectly-sized icons. 

You can see these icons at the bottom of the menu displayed in the previous section.

The first step is to go to '''Appearance > Menus''' and '''create a new menu''' - you can name your menu anything you like.

You will then add the URL for each social profile to your menu as a custom link.

When you have added all desired links, '''click Save Menu'''.

Now that you have created your menu and added your social links, '''go to the Manage Locations tab''' and next to "Social Links Menu", select the social icons menu you just created from the drop down.

A Weblog Client is software you run on your local machine (desktop) that lets you post to your blog via [[XML-RPC_Support|XML-RPC]].  In some cases, the Weblog Client can even manage your weblog entries.  You might think of Weblog Clients as the equivalent of email clients such as Outlook Express, [http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/ Thunderbird], and Eudora Mail.  Essentially, the Weblog Client allows you to write a post even if you are off-line; then, the next time you connect to the Internet, you can publish that post.

For information on blogging by email, see [[Blog by Email]].

==Advantages==

# The ability to write posts without having to go on-line
# The ability to save drafts
# A nicer interface 
# Fancy formatting features

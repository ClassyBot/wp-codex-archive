<p>This is not an easy answer. Spammers use different tactics, and each plugin will use different tactics in response. There is no plugin that will keep you spam-free forever. Comment spammers can download the plugins, see how they work, and figure out a way around them. 
</p><p>Check plugin authors' sites for updates. WordPress makes it easy to find updates via the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Plugins_-_Add_Functionality_to_your_Blog" title="Administration Panels" class="mw-redirect">Plugin panel</a> and the link to the plugin author's website.
</p><p>Comment spam technology is changing fast on both sides, so keep updated with the latest news on comment spam techniques and WordPress Plugin options.

<p>Visit the plugin author's site to see if they have already offered a solution, and if they offer support directly. If not, <b>search the forums first</b> before posting as the answer may be there. If there is no answer, then post a support request on that plugin's support forum.

<p>If you do not have comment spam plugins or the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wordpress.org/download/">latest version of WordPress</a> installed, this may happen. <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress" title="Upgrading WordPress" class="mw-redirect">Upgrade</a> or install one of the comment spam plugins and manually delete the comment spam from your <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Manage_-_Change_your_content" title="Administration Panels" class="mw-redirect">Manage</a> &gt; <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Comments" title="Administration Panels" class="mw-redirect">Comments</a> panel.

With that option selected, all comments are sent to the moderation queue to await approval.  Make sure that <b>Hold a comment in the queue if it contains more than x links</b> is not blank and contains a number higher than zero.  If this value is blank or zero, all comments containing links will be moderated.  If the option mentioned above is unchecked, the link moderation value is higher than zero, and you still have this problem, your <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Spam_Words" title="Spam Words">Spam Words</a> list probably has blank lines, punctuation marks, or single letters between the information in the list.  There should be spaces between the listed items or each item must be on its own line. If you have done this, then upgrade the comment spam plugins you have installed. If this continues to be a problem, deactivate the comment spam plugins one by one to determine the culprit and contact the plugin author for help.

<p>Yes, it is. Please be sure to drop by the plugin author's page and say "Thanks." They deserve the appreciation and look forward to hearing about your suggestions and experiences with their work. This will no doubt help to encourage them to continue the development of their plugin(s).

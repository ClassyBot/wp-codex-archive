“Gutenberg” is the codename for the 2017 WordPress editor focus. The goal of this focus is to create a new post and page editing experience that makes it easy for anyone to create rich post layouts.
Gutenberg is planned to merge into WordPress core, but as of now (Sep/2017), it is being developed on [https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg GitHub], and you can try an [https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/ Plugin version].

Note: Keep in mind it's not fully functional, feature complete, or production ready.

== Overview ==
Gutenberg is newly developed, block-oriented editor.

WordPress already supports a large amount of “blocks”, but doesn’t surface them very well, nor does it give them much in the way of layout options. By embracing the blocky nature of rich post content, we will surface the blocks that already exist, as well as provide more advanced layout options for each of them.

Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage. The idea combines concepts of what in WordPress today we achieve with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience.

== Installation ==
As of now (Sep/2017), Gutenberg is released as Plugin. Installation steps are same with usual plugin.

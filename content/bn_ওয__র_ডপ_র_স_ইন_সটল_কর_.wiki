WordPress is well-known for its ease of installation. Under most circumstances, installing WordPress is a very simple process and takes less than five minutes to complete. Many web hosts now offer tools (e.g. Fantastico) to automatically install WordPress for you. However, if you wish to install WordPress yourself, the following guide will help. Now with Automatic Upgrade, [[Upgrading WordPress|upgrading]] is even easier.

The following installation guide will help you, whether you go for the ''Famous 5 Minute Installation'', or require the more detailed installation guide.

== ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস ইনস্টল করার আগে আপনার যা জানা প্রয়োজন ==
Before you begin the install, there are a few things you need to have and do.

These are:

* Access to your [[Glossary#Web server|web server]] (via [[Glossary#Shell|shell]] or [[Glossary#FTP|FTP]])
* A [[Glossary#Text editor|text editor]]
* An [[FTP_Clients|FTP Client]]
* Your web browser of choice

===ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস ইনস্টল করার জন্য আপনার যা যা প্রয়োজন ===

Begin your installation by:

# Checking to ensure that you and your web host have the [http://wordpress.org/about/requirements/ minimum requirements to run WordPress].
# [http://wordpress.org/download/ Download] the latest release of WordPress.
# Unzip the downloaded file to a folder on your hard drive.
# Be prepared with a [[Editing wp-config.php|secure password for your Secret Key]]
# Print this page out so you have it handy during the installation.

== বিখ্যাত ৫ মিনিটের ইনস্টল ==

Here's the quick version of the instructions for those who are already comfortable with performing such installations. More [[#Detailed_Instructions|detailed instructions]] follow. 

If you are not comfortable with renaming files, step 3 is optional and you can skip it as the install program will create the <tt>wp-config.php</tt> file for you. 

# Download and unzip the WordPress package if you haven't already.
# Create a database for WordPress on your web server, as well as a [[Glossary#MySQL|MySQL]] user who has all privileges for accessing and modifying it.
# (Optional) Find and rename <tt>wp-config-sample.php</tt> to <tt>wp-config.php</tt>, then edit the file (see [[Editing wp-config.php]]) and add your database information.
# Upload the WordPress files to the desired location on your web server:
#* If you want to integrate WordPress into the root of your domain (e.g. <tt><nowiki>http://example.com/</nowiki></tt>), move or upload all contents of the unzipped WordPress directory (excluding the WordPress directory itself) into the root directory of your web server.
#* If you want to have your WordPress installation in its own subdirectory on your website (e.g. <tt><nowiki>http://example.com/blog/</nowiki></tt>), create the <tt>blog</tt> directory on your server and upload the contents of the unzipped WordPress package to the directory via FTP.
#* '''''Note:''' If your FTP client has an option to convert file names to lower case, make sure it's disabled.''
# Run the WordPress installation script by accessing the URL in a web browser. This should be the URL where you uploaded the WordPress files.
#* If you installed WordPress in the root directory, you should visit: <tt><nowiki>http://example.com/</nowiki></tt>
#* If you installed WordPress in its own subdirectory called <tt>blog</tt>, for example, you should visit: <tt><nowiki>http://example.com/blog/</nowiki></tt>

That's it! WordPress should now be installed.

== বিস্তারিত নির্দেশনা ==

=== ধাপ ১: ডাউনলোড এবং এক্সট্রাক্ট ===

If you work on your own computer, on most Linux distributions you can install WordPress automatically: on Mageia (KDE), thanks to Mageia control center; on Fedora 20 (Gnome), you will not find it in "Software", which only include applications with proper GUI, but you can install from there a package called "Packages" containing the application "Packages", alias "Software install", and, thanks to "Packages", you can install WordPress. We advise you to install PhpMyAdmin at the same time.

Download and unzip the WordPress package from http://wordpress.org/download/.
* If you will be uploading WordPress to a remote web server, download the WordPress package to your computer with a web browser and unzip the package.
* If you will be using FTP, skip to the next step - uploading files is covered later.
* If you have [[Glossary#Shell|shell]] access to your web server, and are comfortable using console-based tools, you may wish to download WordPress directly to your [[Glossary#Web server|web server]] using <tt>wget</tt> (or <tt>lynx</tt> or another console-based web browser) if you want to avoid [[Glossary#FTP|FTPing]]:
** <tt>wget <nowiki>http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz</nowiki></tt>
** Then unzip the package using: <br /> <tt>tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz </tt> <br><br>The WordPress package will extract into a folder called <tt>wordpress</tt> in the same directory that you downloaded <tt>latest.tar.gz</tt>.

If you are using a [[Glossary#Hosting provider|hosting provider]], you may already have a WordPress database set up for you, or there may be an automated setup solution to do so. Check your hosting provider's support pages or your [[Using cPanel|control panel]] for clues about whether or not you'll need to create one manually.

If you determine that you'll need to create one manually, follow the instructions for [[WordPress_Backups#Accessing_phpMyAdmin|accessing phpMyAdmin on various servers]], or follow the instructions for [[#Using_cPanel|'''Using cPanel''']] or [[#Using phpMyAdmin|'''Using phpMyAdmin''']] below.

If you are installing WordPress on your own web server, follow the [[#Using phpMyAdmin|'''Using phpMyAdmin''']] or [[#Using the MySQL Client|'''Using the MySQL Client''']] instructions below to create your WordPress username and database.

If you have only one database and it is already in use, you can install WordPress in it - just make sure to have a distinctive prefix for your tables to avoid over-writing any existing database table.

==== সিপ্যানেল ব্যবহার করা ====

If your hosting provider supplies the [[Glossary#cPanel|cPanel]] hosting control panel, you may follow these simple instructions to create your WordPress username and database.  A more complete set of instructions for using cPanel to create the database and user can be found in [[Using cPanel]].

# Log in to your [[Glossary#cPanel|cPanel]].
# Click '''MySQL Database Wizard''' icon under the Databases section.
# In '''Step 1. Create a Database''' enter the database name and click Next Step.
# In '''Step 2. Create Database Users''' enter the database user name and the password.  Make sure to use a strong password. Click Create User.
# In '''Step 3. Add User to Database''' click the All Privileges checkbox and click Next Step. 
# In '''Step 4. Complete the task''' note the database name and user.  Write down the values of ''hostname'', ''username'', ''databasename'', and the password you chose. (Note that ''hostname'' will usually be '''localhost'''.)

==== Using Lunarpages.com's custom cPanel (LPCP) ====

Lunarpages has developed their own version of cPanel. 

# Log in to your account.
# Go to Control Panel.
# Click on the button on the left panel labeled 'Go to LPCP'.
# Go to MySQL Manager.
# Add the user name and database name but leave the host name as the default IP number.
# Note the IP address of the database on the right which is different from the default IP number of the host indicated in the above step.
# When modifying the WP-CONFIG.PHP file, use the DB IP number, not 'LOCALHOST'.
# When modifying the WP-CONFIG.PHP file, be sure to use the full name of the database and user name, typically 'accountname_nameyoucreated'.
# Refer to http://wiki.lunarpages.com/Create_and_Delete_MySQL_Users_in_LPCP for more info.

If your web server has [[Glossary#phpMyAdmin|phpMyAdmin]] installed, you may follow these instructions to create your WordPress username and database. If you work on your own computer, on most Linux distributions you can install PhpMyAdmin automatically.

'''''Note:''' These instructions are written for phpMyAdmin 3.5; the phpMyAdmin user interface can vary slightly between versions.''

# If a database relating to WordPress does not already exist in the '''Database''' dropdown on the left, create one:
## Choose a name for your WordPress database: '<tt>wordpress</tt>' or '<tt>blog</tt>' are good, but most hosting services (specially shared hosting) will require a name beginning with your username there and an underscore, so, even if you work on your own computer, we advise you to check now your hosting service requirements so that you conform with them on your own server and would be able to transfer your database without modification when it will be ready. Enter the chosen database name in the '''Create database''' field and choose the best collation for your language and encoding. In most cases it's better to choose in the "utf8_" series and, if you don't find your language, to choose "utf8_unicode_ci" (Reference: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/766809/whats-the-difference-between-utf8-general-ci-and-utf8-unicode-ci StackOverFlow.com]).[[File:phpMyAdmin_create_database.jpg|700px|thumb|center|After naming the database (here "fiable_wordpress") and choosing the collation (here "unicode_general_ci"), click on the '''Create''' button]]
# Click the '''phpMyAdmin''' icon in the upper left to return to the main page, then click the '''Users''' tab. If a user relating to WordPress does not already exist in the list of users, create one: [[File:users.jpg|800px|thumb|center|]]
## Click '''Add user'''.
## Choose a username for WordPress ('<tt>wordpress</tt>' is good) and enter it in the '''User name''' field. (Be sure '''Use text field:''' is selected from the dropdown.)
## Choose a difficult-to-guess password (ideally containing a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols), and enter it in the '''Password''' field. (Be sure '''Use text field:''' is selected from the dropdown.) Re-enter the password in the '''Re-type''' field.
## Write down the username and password you chose.
## Leave all options under '''Global privileges''' at their defaults.
## Click '''Go'''.
# Return to the '''Users''' screen and click the '''Edit privileges''' icon on the user you've just created for WordPress. In the '''Database-specific privileges''' section, select the database you've just created for WordPress under the '''Add privileges to the following database''' dropdown. The page will refresh with privileges for that database. Click '''Check All''' to select all privileges, and click '''Go'''.
# On the resulting page, make note of the host name listed after '''Server:''' at the top of the page. (This will usually be '''localhost'''.)

You can create MySQL users and databases quickly and easily by running mysql from the shell. The syntax is shown below and the dollar sign is the command prompt:

<pre>
$ mysql -u adminusername -p
Enter password:
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 5340 to server version: 3.23.54
 
Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.
 
mysql> CREATE DATABASE databasename;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
 
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON databasename.* TO "wordpressusername"@"hostname"
    -> IDENTIFIED BY "password";
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
  
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> EXIT
Bye
$ 
</pre>

The example shows:
* that <tt>root</tt> is also the ''adminusername''. It is a safer practice to choose a so-called "mortal" account as your mysql admin, so that you are not entering the command "mysql" as the root user on your system. (Any time you can avoid doing work as root you decrease your chance of being exploited). The name you use depends on the name you assigned as the database administrator using mysqladmin. 
* <tt>wordpress</tt> or <tt>blog</tt> are good values for ''databasename''.
* <tt>wordpress</tt> is a good value for ''wordpressusername'' but you should realize that, since it is used here, the entire world will know it too.
* ''hostname'' will usually be <tt>localhost</tt>. If you don't know what this value should be, check with your system administrator if you are not the admin for your Wordpress host.  If you are the system admin, consider using a non-root account to administer your database.
* ''password'' should be a difficult-to-guess password, ideally containing a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols. One good way of avoiding the use of a word found in a dictionary is to use the first letter of each word in a phrase that you find easy to remember.

If you need to write these values somewhere, avoid writing them in the system that contains the things protected by them. You need to remember the value used for ''databasename'', ''wordpressusername'', ''hostname'', and ''password''. Of course, since they are already in (or will be shortly) your wp-config.php file, there is no need to put them somewhere else, too.

a. Regular "User" of a single-site webhosting account logs in normally. Then click "MySQL Management." (If this is not readily visible, perhaps your host needs to modify your "package" to activate MySQL.) Then follow part "c" below.

b. "Reseller" accounts or "Admin" accounts may need to click "User Level." They also must first log-in as "Reseller" if the relevant domain is a Reseller's primary domain... or log-in as a "User" if the domain is not a Reseller's primary domain. If a Reseller's primary domain, then when logged-in as Reseller, you simply click "User Level." However if the relevant domain is not the Reseller's primary domain, then you must log-in as the relevant User. Then click "MySQL Management." (If not readily visible, perhaps you need to return to the Reseller or Admin level, and modify the "Manage user package" or "Manage Reseller package" to enable MySQL.)

c. In "MySQL Management," click on the small words: "Create new database." Here you are asked to submit two suffixes for the database and its username. For maximum security, use two different sets of 4-6 random characters. Then the password field has a "Random" button that generates an 8-character password. You may also add more characters to the password for maximum security. "Create." The next screen will summarize the database, username, password and hostname. Be sure to copy and paste these into a text file for future reference.

== সাধারণ ইনস্টলেশন সমস্যা ==

The following are some of the most common installation problems.  For more information and troubleshooting for problems with your WordPress installation, check out [[FAQ Installation]] and [[FAQ Troubleshooting]].

'''I see a directory listing rather than a web page.'''

The web server needs to be told to view <tt>index.php</tt> by default. In Apache, use the <tt>DirectoryIndex index.php</tt> directive. The simplest option is to create a file named <tt>.htaccess</tt> in the installed directory and place the directive there. Another option is to add the directive to the web server's configuration files.

'''I see lots of <tt>Headers already sent</tt> errors. How do I fix this?'''

You probably introduced a syntax error in editing <tt>wp-config.php</tt>.
# Download <tt>wp-config.php</tt> (if you don't have [[Glossary#Shell|shell]] access).
# Open it in a [[Glossary#Text editor|text editor]].
# Check that the first line contains nothing but <tt><?php</tt>, and that there is '''no''' text before it (not even whitespace).
# Check that the last line contains nothing but <tt>?></tt>, and that there is '''no''' text after it (not even whitespace).
# If your text editor saves as Unicode, make sure it adds '''no byte order mark (BOM)'''.  Most Unicode-enabled text editors do not inform the user whether it adds a BOM to files; if so, try using a different text editor.
# Save the file, upload it again if necessary, and reload the page in your browser.

'''My page comes out gibberish. When I look at the source I see a lot of "<tt><?php ?></tt>" tags.'''

If the <tt><?php ?></tt> tags are being sent to the browser, it means your [[Glossary#PHP|PHP]] is not working properly. All PHP code is supposed to be executed ''before'' the server sends the resulting [[Glossary#HTML|HTML]] to your web browser. (That's why it's called a ''pre''processor.) Make sure your web server meets the requirements to run WordPress, that PHP is installed and configured properly, or contact your hosting provider or system administrator for assistance.

'''I keep getting an <tt>Error connecting to database</tt> message but I'm sure my configuration is correct.'''

Try resetting your MySQL password manually. If you have access to MySQL via shell, try issuing:

 SET PASSWORD FOR '<var>wordpressusername</var>'@'<var>hostname</var>' = OLD_PASSWORD('<var>password</var>');

If you are using a version of MySQL prior to 4.1, use <tt>PASSWORD</tt> instead of <tt>OLD_PASSWORD</tt>. If you do not have shell access, you should be able to simply enter the above into an SQL query in phpMyAdmin. Failing that, you may need to use your host's control panel to reset the password for your database user.

'''My image/MP3 uploads aren't working.'''

If you use the Rich Text Editor on a blog  that's installed in a subdirectory, and drag a newly uploaded image into  the editor  field, the image may vanish a couple seconds later. This is due to a problem with TinyMCE (the rich text editor) not getting enough information during the drag operation to construct the path to the image or other file  correctly. The solution is to  NOT drag uploaded images into the editor. Instead, click and  hold on the image and select "Send to Editor."

A ''software appliance'' allows users to altogether skip manual installation of WordPress and its dependencies, and instead deploy a self-contained system that requires little to no setup, in just a couple of minutes.

=== Easy 5 Minute WordPress Installation on Windows ===
Download, install, and configure WordPress with the [http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/wordpress.aspx Microsoft Web Platform Installer] ([http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/wordpress.aspx Web PI]). Installation is very easy and takes on average about 5 minutes to complete. For other Windows installers, check [[Installing_WordPress#Local_Installation_Instructions|this section]]

;Step 1. Things you need to know before starting.
#These steps will work on Windows versions which include IIS, such as Windows XP professional, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows Server.
#You must be able to install programs on your machine (i.e. have administrator rights).
#Once Web PI is installed, neither XAMPP nor any other web server will be able to use localhost to host a website locally on your machine.
;Step 2. Navigate to the [http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/wordpress.aspx WordPress Installation Page]
#Choose the "Install" button.
#If you have [http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/wordpress.aspx Web PI] already installed, it will automatically be launched and you can skip to the next step.
#If you do not have the [http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/wordpress.aspx Web Platform Installer], you will be prompted to install it.
#[http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/wordpress.aspx Web PI] is a tool from Microsoft that downloads and installs the latest components you need to develop or host Web applications on Windows. Everything in the tool is free. [http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/wordpress.aspx Web PI] will install and configure IIS, PHP, MySQL and anything else you may need.
;Step 3. Choose to Install WordPress
#When [http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/wordpress.aspx Web PI] launches, you will see an information page for WordPress. Start installing WordPress by pressing the "Install" button in the lower right hand corner.
;Step 4. Installation of WordPress and its requirements
#Finding Dependencies: [http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/wordpress.aspx Web PI] will determine the minimum set of components and modules you need on your machine to run WordPress. It will only install what you’re missing. For example, PHP will be installed and configured to run WordPress.
#Configure the Database: After accepting the terms, if you need to install MySQL, you will be asked to create a password for the root account database account. Keep this password safe. WordPress will ask for this information later. 
#Choose the site: Choose a site to install WordPress to. You may install to an existing website in IIS or create a new site. Use the default setting if you do not have advanced configuration needs.
#WordPress Setup: WordPress will need answers to a few specific questions such as the username (in the case of a new MySQL install is root) and password for your MySQL database to complete the install.
;Step 5. Completion
#Once you enter the WordPress setup information, Web PI will finish the installation. 
#Click, Launch in Browser and WordPress will launch.

Alternatively, the [http://bitnami.org/stack/wordpress BitNami WordPress installer] is a free, self-contained native installer for WordPress that includes Apache, MySQL and PHP so it works out of the box.

==== WAMP ====

If you don't have IIS on your computer or don't want to use it, you could use a WAMP Stack :
* [http://www.wampserver.com/en/download.php WAMP Server] or [http://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/ WAMP Server at SourceForge] 
* [http://ampps.com/download AMPPS WAMPStack] - has Softaculous WordPress Installer
* [http://easyphp.org/ EasyPHP] - Has WordPress installer plugin
* [http://bitnami.org/stack/wampstack BitNami WAMPStack] - Has WordPress stack
* [http://www.apachefriends.org/ XAMPP WAMPStack]

These stacks can be downloaded freely and set up all the bits you need on your computer to run a website.  Once you have downloaded and installed WAMP, you can point your browser at [http://localhost/ localhost] and use the link to phpmyadmin to create a database. 

Then, in order to install WordPress, download the zip file, and extract it into the web directory for your WAMP installation (this is normally installed as c:\wamp\www). Finally visit http://localhost/wordpress to start the WordPress install. (Assuming you extracted into c:\wamp\www\wordpress).

Tip: If you want to use anything other than the default permalink structure on your install, make sure you enable the mod_rewrite module in WAMP. This can be enabled by clicking on the WAMP icon in the taskbar, then hover over Apache in the menu, then Apache modules and ensure that the rewrite_module item has a checkmark next to it.

<p>All of the documentation at the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://codex.wordpress.org">Codex</a> has been produced by users like you and me!

<p>Slack has replaced IRC as a way to organize and get work done on WordPress. The community is vibrant, responsive, and very active. Please join us on our <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Slack channel</a> and start getting involved today.

<p>Another support mechanism for WordPress users is IRC. There is an IRC channel for discussions on WordPress topics on the IRC FreeNode Server at <tt>#wordpress</tt>, and you can help by answering questions there.

<p>One way to participate in WordPress development is to suggest features and participate in the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Development_Planning" title="Development Planning">development planning</a> process.  Even if you aren't a developer, you can help build consensus and formalize proposals, boiling down long email threads and IRC logs to their essence, so that developers can quickly ascertain what the community is hoping to achieve with a particular feature.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Testing_WordPress">Testing WordPress</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/index.php?title=Contributing_to_WordPress&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Testing WordPress">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Another valuable contribution a non-developer (or developer) can make to WordPress development is to test WordPress. Before every stable release of WordPress, pre-release versions are made to enable testing. You can download the pre-releases and test them, so that the WordPress developers can fix problems before the new version is made available to the public. If you would like to get involved in this effort, join the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists#Testers" title="Mailing Lists">wp-testers mailing list</a>, where new releases are announced and discussed. 
</p><p>If you want to be on the bleeding edge of development, even before pre-release versions are put together, you can also check out the latest software from the WordPress Subversion (SVN) repository, as outlined in <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Subversion" title="Using Subversion">Using Subversion</a>. Or, you can get the "nightly build" (which is created from the Subversion repository, and available as a zip file) at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://wordpress.org/nightly-builds/wordpress-latest.zip">http://wordpress.org/nightly-builds/wordpress-latest.zip</a> -- almost as up-to-date as the instantaneous Subversion repository.
</p><p>If you find bugs while testing pre-release or already-released versions of WordPress, see the section just below.

<p>Another way you can contribute to WordPress development is by reporting any problems you find with the WordPress software. The process of reporting bugs is described in <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Reporting_Bugs" title="Reporting Bugs">Reporting Bugs</a> -- please start by reading that article. Once you have understood the bug reporting process, you can search the WordPress <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://trac.wordpress.org/">Trac</a> database to see if your issue has already been reported, and if not, file a new report. Your help with reporting bugs will be highly appreciated.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fixing_Bugs_and_Other_Programming">Fixing Bugs and Other Programming</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/index.php?title=Contributing_to_WordPress&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: Fixing Bugs and Other Programming">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>If you are a software developer, you can also help the development of WordPress by fixing problems that have been reported by you or another person in the WordPress <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://trac.wordpress.org/">Trac</a> database. This process is also known as "patching", and is described in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-bugs/">Reporting Bugs</a>. That article also has some suggestions on how to find bugs to fix.
</p><p>You can also subscribe to the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists#Hackers" title="Mailing Lists">wp-hackers mailing list</a> to participate in discussions regarding WordPress development. All contributions, ideas and suggestions are welcome at the mailing list. Sometimes, requests are also made on the list asking for the help of volunteers to assist in the improvement and development of specific functionality. 
</p><p>If you are not familiar with the patching process or how to use Subversion, we recommend  <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://openhatch.org/missions/">OpenHatch Training Missions</a> as an easy learning tool.
</p><p>Occasionally there are also bug days on the <tt>#wordpress-bugs</tt> IRC channel. You can read about what happens in a bug day in <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Bug_Hunts" title="WordPress Bug Hunts">WordPress Bug Hunts</a>, and subscribe to either the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists#Hackers" title="Mailing Lists">wp-hackers</a> or <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists#Testers" title="Mailing Lists">wp-testers</a> mailing list to find out when they happen.

<p>If you enjoy WordPress or find it to be useful, put a link to WordPress on your site. You can do this with a text link, or use one of the many <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wordpress.org/about/logos/">WordPress logos</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wordpress.org/about/fanart/">buttons</a> on your site with a link to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.wordpress.org">http://wordpress.org</a>.

<p>The WordPress Community exists because everyone takes part in some way, by giving their time, energy, and sometimes even money, because they believe in the valuable services WordPress provides. We invite you to join the community in whatever way you feel is appropriate, and donating money to WordPress Theme and Plugin authors and developers who give so freely of their creativity and expertise by offering their services for free to all WordPress users is a good place to start.
</p><p>If you use a WordPress Theme or Plugin and your WordPress blog depends upon it, contact the author and find out how you can give back and support their continued efforts. It takes a lot of time and energy to create and then support Themes and Plugins, keeping them updated as WordPress changes and bugs are found. Many take donations or appreciate it when you blog about their Plugin or Theme. Others offer their Plugins and Themes as <i>experiential portfolios</i> - you play with it, you like it, you hire them. Most clearly indicate how they appreciate compensation for their hard work - give back to WordPress by giving back to them.
</p><p>The more the WordPress Community supports the programmers, developers, testers, and challengers, the stronger and better WordPress becomes. Sometimes that means donating money, sometimes it means saying thank you. 
</p><p>Just remember, every contribution counts, no matter what it looks like. It takes every one of us to make WordPress better.

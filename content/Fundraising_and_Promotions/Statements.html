Although wrangling together a domain name and Web hosting space and then uploading the WordPress software can be intimidating to newcomers, once it's set up this hosted option is one of your easiest for ongoing use....WordPress is gaining in popularity quickly, with more than 200,000 downloads in its first three months.

<dd>Compared with other server-based weblog platforms like Movable Type (MT) and Greymatter, WordPress is relatively easier to install. It also doesn't take up as much server space. With a great interface and powerful features, it's definitely a weblog software worth considering...Regardless of some inadequacies, WordPress is a highly recommended software for anyone who wants a powerful server-based weblog without the fuss of going through a complicated installation process. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://weblogs.about.com/cs/blogsoftware/gr/wordpress.htm">About.com's Weblog Reviews  by Sheila Ann Manuel Coggins</a></dd></dl>

<dd>"Well, there's no official claim like this coming from Infinite Loop, but it just so happens that Apple's student blog is not only run off of WordPress, which has been a known fact for a while, but Apple has now updated the site so that is proclaims "Powered by WordPress" in the sidebar. Of course, this isn't an endorsement, as you'll notice from the text immediately above the "Powered by WordPress" bit.

<dd>"I can’t get over how impressive Wordpress and the Wordpress team is. As a long-time user of free/open source software, the idea that a team of people would voluntarily give their time and great effort to creating and maintaining an excellent piece of software is nothing new to me. Yet I am consistantly blown away by each new realease. The product itself is as easy to use and elegantly designed that it keeps from view just how powerful it really is. And their website’s Installing and Upgranding Wordpress wikis are the sort of Help pages most every open source app I’ve ever used was lacking. They’re simply a pleasure to use."

This time round that hadn’t even popped into my mind… of course I was going to use WordPress to put it together, why would I waste my time and expend my energy on doing it any other way?...It’s Kodak for the internet… so why on earth would you want a website when you can have a blogsite?"</dd></dl>

<dd>"The ease of putting up pages on wordpress was amazing. I wouldn't hesitate to use wordpress to manage content for almost any small business's website. It makes the process extremely simple...by starting with WordPress and having the ability to choose from 1000s of already built layouts, the process of building a sharp looking website that is easy to manage couldn't be much easier. Dreamhost, like a lot of other hosting companies, makes it even easier by enabling the wordpress install process through a web interface."</dd></dl>

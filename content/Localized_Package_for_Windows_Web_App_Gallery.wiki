[http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/ Windows Web App Gallery] is an online web app browser for [http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx Microsoft Web Platform Installer] (Web PI). If you're maintaining a localized version of WordPress in one of Web PI's [[#Supported Languages|supported languages]], you can add it to the Web App Gallery.

'''Note:''' As of now, submission of updated version is done manually. ''Please make sure to submit a new release after every update'' because the past submissions will become obsolete (yet shown as the latest version on the Gallery).

==How To Submit Your Package==
Generic steps for submitting apps to the Web App Gallery are described on [http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/developer.aspx Microsoft's site]. Below are WordPress-specific instructions.

The following steps assume that you are using WordPress.org's build tool. This means you are using the admin panel of ''lang''.wordpress.org to create releases.<br />
You can read about local sites on this Codex page: [[International_WordPress_Sites]].

There are 5 steps to this process:

# [[#Translate_parameters.xml_File|Translate parameters.xml File]]
# [[#Add_XML_Files_to_the_SVN_Repository|Add XML Files to the SVN Repository]]
# [[#Build_a_Package|Build a Package]]
# [[#Test_Your_Package|Test Your Package]]
# [[#Submit|Submit]]

=== Translate parameters.xml File ===
Download and translate this XML file on the WordPress SVN repository.

 <tt>http://core.svn.wordpress.org/branches/iis/parameters.xml</tt>

Not everything has to be translated. You can take a look at [http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress-i18n/ja/branches/iis/parameters.xml the Japanese version of the same file] to find which attributes need translation.

=== Add XML Files to the SVN Repository ===

Create <tt>/branches/iis/</tt> directory within your language folder. It will look like this:

 <tt><nowiki>http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress-i18n/</nowiki>''lang''/branches/iis/</tt>

Then add your <tt>parameters.xml</tt> file (above) under the directory. You will also need to add copies of <tt>[http://core.svn.wordpress.org/branches/iis/manifest.xml manifest.xml]</tt> and <tt>[http://core.svn.wordpress.org/branches/iis/install.sql install.sql]</tt> files. Nothing needs to be changed in these English files. Now your <tt>iis</tt> directory should include three files.

Again, see [http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress-i18n/ja/branches/iis/ ja directory] as an example.

=== Build a Package ===

Log in to your local site (''lang''.wordpress.org/wp-admin) and go to "Tools > Translations for ''lang'' to create a new package. You won't be publicly releasing this, so the package branch doesn't matter.

Your package for the Web App Gallery should appear on the "Build" list as X.X.X-IIS, along with regular X.X.X version. Download the zip format of the IIS version (don't unzip).

=== Test Your Package ===

Before submitting for the first time, you should test the package you've just downloaded. For instructions, please read the "Test Your Package" section of [http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/578/package-an-application-for-the-windows-web-application-gallery/ IIS.net web site].

=== Submit ===

Go to the [http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/AppSubmit.aspx App Submission page] on the Web App Gallery and fill out the form (Use the dropdown at the top to toggle languages). You will need to login with Windows Live &trade; ID. Your translation team will probably want to create a shared Windows Live ID.

* Make sure to select the correct app '''language'''.
* Use appropriate "Name" and "Nickname" for your localized package, insted of just "WordPress".
* Primary & Secondary categories should be both '''"Blogs"'''.
* Under "Dependencies", select '''PHP for "Framework or Runtime"''' and '''MySQL for "Database"'''.
* Package Location URL is the IIS package's zip file location, like this: <tt><nowiki>http://ja.wordpress.org/builds/ja/tags/2.8.6/wordpress-2.8.6-IIS-ja.zip</nowiki></tt>
* To obtain the zip package's '''SHA-1 Hash''', use this documentations: [http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/841290 Windows] / [http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1652 Mac]

You will receive a submission confirmation, after the form is completed. Then you should receive an app creation notice in a few days/hours.

When a new build is created, you will need to go through this "Submit" step. The second email you'll receive will say "SUBMISSION MODIFIED: ..." in the subject line.

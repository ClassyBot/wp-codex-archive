<p>Suppose you have WordPress running at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>.  Also, suppose  that you want your blog to be located at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://example.com/blog/">http://example.com/blog/</a> and that you want other pages to be available at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://example.com/page1/">http://example.com/page1/</a>.
</p><p>The first thing you will want to do is to create a homepage.  You can do this by creating home.php in your theme directory.  Next, create a blog template.  The easiest way to do this is to create a file named blog.php with the following contents in your theme directory:
</p><p><strong><b>Note:</b> the home.php file is not needed in versions 2.1+. Please see <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_a_Static_Front_Page" title="Creating a Static Front Page">Creating A Static Front Page</a> to learn about how to create separate blog and front pages.</strong>
</p>
<pre>
&lt;?php
/*
Template Name: Blog
*/

// Which page of the blog are we on?
$paged = get_query_var('paged');
query_posts('cat=-0&amp;paged='.$paged);

// make posts print only the first part with a link to rest of the post.
global $more;
$more = 0;

//load index to show blog
load_template(TEMPLATEPATH . '/index.php');
?&gt;
</pre>
<p>Log in to WordPress and create a page named "Blog" with Template "blog".  You're done.  The one last thing you will want to do is to update your permalinks structure to begin with "/blog/", i.e., "/blog/%year%/%monthnum%/%postname%/".  Now you have a WordPress-managed CMS with a unique front page and logically-structured blog content.
</p><p>If you're using the &lt;!-- more --&gt; quicktag to place things below the fold in your posts, you'll want to include the global variable $more and set it to zero (as shown in the code above). Otherwise, the entire post will print out on your blog's main page.

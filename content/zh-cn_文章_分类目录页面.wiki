==文章 &rarr; 分类目录==

WordPress 中的每篇文章都属于一个或多个分类目录。这有助于站点的导航，同时便于组织内容相似的文章。

每个分类目录都可以拥有父级目录，也就是说，分类目录就可以拥有层级关系。请注意，创建分类目录时，分类目录名称必须是唯一的。因此，就算两个分类目录分别隶属于不通的父级目录，您仍需为它们设置不同的名称。

默认情况下，比如您在使用 {{DefaultTheme}}，在博客首页的两个位置以链接的形式显示：边栏的相应小工具中，和每篇文章的下方。用户点击这些链接，即可看到所有在该分类目录中的文章。

您可在该页面创建、编辑或删除分类目录，亦可为它们设置层级关系。

==Manage Categories==
This Screen is divided into the Popular Categories, Add Category and Category Table sections. 

===Add New Category===
This part of the Screen, which is conveniently linked to from the top of the [[#Table of Categories|Table of Categories]], allows you to create a new Category.  There are four pieces of information associated with each new Category:  the name, slug, category parent, and description.

;Name: To reiterate, the Category Name ''must'' be unique.
;Slug: The Category slug ''must'' be unique. The Category Slug is used in the URL. For example, setting a Category Name of "Recipes" and a Category Slug of "food" would show all "Recipes" posts with a URL like '''example.com/blog/food/'''.
;Parent: Use this drop-down if you want to make this Category a sub-Category; you will select the sub-Category's Parent here.  For example, you may have a Category called "Photos" but want to add further clarification about the subject of a particular "Photos" post.  You could add "Oregon Coast" and "Ice Storm" as sub-Categories to the "Photos" Category; "Photos" would be the Parent of these two new sub-Categories.
:Sub-Categories show up on your blog's page just like Categories, except they will typically be nested under their Parent Categories.  When someone visits your site and clicks the "Photos" Category link, all posts in "Photos" and ''all its sub-Categories'' will be displayed.  Clicking the "Oregon Coast" Category link ''only'' displays those post in that sub-Category.  If you assign a post to a sub-Category (e.g. "Oregon Coast"), you can choose to assign that post to the sub-Category's parent ("Photos") or not.  Either way, all "Oregon Coast" posts will show up in the "Photos" Category page.  The only difference is that the list of Categories of which a particular post is actually a member.  In the WordPress Default 1.6 Theme (Kubrick), this list is shown below the text of each post.
;Description:  Category Descriptions are optional.  Some themes take advantage of Category Descriptions, others do not, so having Descriptions may or may not modify the way Categories are displayed for your site.  Even if they are not used by your site's theme, you may still find them useful from an administration point of view.
;Add New Category:  The most important part of the Add New Category box.  Once you've entered in all the information about your new Category, use this button to save it.

===Table of Categories===
This table lists all of your categories by row.  Categories are displayed hierarchically and alphabetically;  subcategories are displayed beneath their parents and are prefaced by long dashes.  These dashed are ''not'' part of a Category's name;  they are there only to show hierarchy.  

The table of categories contains the following columns:

*'''[ ]''' - A checkbox that when clicked (checked), 'selects' that particular Category to be deleted when the Delete Action is Applied. 
*'''Name''' - The name of the Category.  Remember each Name must be unique.  Click on the Category's Name to [[#Edit Category|edit the Category]].
*'''Description''' - Categories may have an optional description.  By default, the description is shown to viewers when they hover over the category's link.
*'''Slug''' – The slug of a Category.
*'''Posts''' - The number of posts which are members of the Category. Click on the number in the Posts column to be directed to the Edit Posts Screen to manage the Posts in that Category.

====Screen Options====
The Screen Options allow you to choose which columns are displayed, or not displayed, in the underlying Table.  Clicking on the Screen Options tab shows a list of the columns with a check-box next to each column.  Check the box for each column you want displayed in the Table, or uncheck the box to not display that column.  In addition, the number of Categories to display in the [[#Table of Categories|Table of Categories]] can be set.  Click the Screen Options tab again to close the Screen Options.

====Search====
Above the Table, to the right, is a search box where you can enter a word, or series of words, and click the "Search Categories" button to search and display all the Categories meeting your search words.

===Using Selection, Actions, and Apply===
====Selection====
:This section allows Actions to be performed on one or more Categories displayed in the Table.  For Actions to be performed on multiple Categories at once, those Categories must be first '''selected''' via one of these methods:
:*'''Select one Category at a time''' - To select a Category, the checkbox to the left of the Category entry must be checked (clicked).  It is possible to keep selecting more Categories by checking their respective checkbox.
:*'''Select all Categories in given Table''' - All Categories in a given table can be selected by checking the checkbox in the Table's title, or footer bar.  Of course, unchecking the header or footer title bar checkbox will cause all entries in that Table to be unchecked (NOT selected). 
:*'''Reverse Selection''' - A Reverse Selection means checked items become unchecked, and unchecked items become checked. A Reverse Selection is accomplished by holding the Shift key on the keyboard and clicking the header or footer title bar checkbox.

====Actions====
:Actions describe the process to be performed on particular Categories.  There are two styles of Actions that will be referred to as ''Bulk Actions'' and ''Immediate Actions''.  The follow describes these Actions:
:*'''Bulk Actions''' - These Actions can be performed on one, or more Categories, at one time, if those Categories have been previously [[#Selection|selected]]. Bulk Actions are available, when appropriate, as choices in the Actions pulldown box, above each Table.  The only Bulk Action allowed is Delete.   
:*'''Immediate Actions''' - Immediate Actions are performed immediately, on an individual Category.  Hovering the mouse cursor over the Category row reveals the Edit, Quick Edit, and Delete options under the Name column in that Category row.  Clicking on a Category Name will also initiate the Edit Action.

:The available Actions are described below: 
:*'''Edit''' - This Immediate Action displays the Edit Category Screen to edit the Category fields.  This Action can be initiated by click on the Category Name or clicking on the Edit option just below the Category Name.  See the [[#Edit Category|Edit Category section]] for details on editing a Category.
:*'''Quick Edit''' - This Immediate Action initiates the Quick Edit of that Category.  See the [[#Quick Edit|Quick Edit section]] for details doing a Quick Edit on a Category. 
:*'''Delete''' - This Action deletes the Category.  Delete is available as a Bulk Action and an Immediate Action. Note:  Deleting a category does not delete the posts in that Category, but the posts that were assigned to the deleted Category are assigned to the '''Default Category''', as defined in the [[Settings Writing Screen]].  Note that the Default Category cannot be deleted.

====Apply====
:After one or more Categories are ''selected'', and after a ''Bulk'' Action is specified, the '''Apply''' button performs the given Action on the selected Categories.

:*'''Apply''' - Click the Apply button to execute the Bulk Action, specified in the Actions pulldown, on the selected Categories.  Remember, prior to executing Actions, one or more Categories must be '''selected''', as described before.

===Quick Edit===
: The following fields can be change via the Quick Edit Action:

;Category name: To reiterate, the Category name ''must'' be unique.
;Category slug: Again, the Category slug ''must'' be unique. 

;Cancel: Click this button to cancel any changes and return to the Table of Categories
;Update Category: Once you've edited all the information about the Category, use this button to save the changes.

===Edit Category===
This Screen only displays when you click on a Categories' '''Name''' in the [[#Table of Categories|Table of Categories]].  It is possible to edit four pieces of information associated with each Category:  the name, the slug, the parent, and the description.

;Category name: To reiterate, the Category name ''must'' be unique.
;Category Slug: Again, the Category slug ''must'' be unique. 
;Category Parent: Use this drop-down if you want to make this Category a sub-Category; you will select the sub-Category's Parent here.  For example, you may have a Category called "Photos" but want to add further clarification about the subject of a particular "Photos" post.  You could add "Oregon Coast" and "Ice Storm" as sub-Categories to the "Photos" Category; "Photos" would be the parent of these two new sub-Categories.
;Description:  Category descriptions are optional.  Some themes take advantage of Category descriptions, others do not, so having Descriptions may or may not modify the way Categories are displayed for your site.  
;Update:  Once you've changed the Category information, use this button to save the changes.

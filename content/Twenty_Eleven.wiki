'''What are the available Post Formats?'''

In addition to the Standard Format (regular blog posts) there are seven additional formats you can choose to publish. To clarify what the other Post Formats are, following is a great explanation from WordPress.com:

<blockquote>
The '''Aside Format''' is for shorter posts of about 1 paragraph. Because they’re shorter and meant to be digested quickly the title of the Aside post is hidden on Index pages.

The '''Link Format''' looks a lot like the Aside post but if you’re using the Twenty Eleven Ephemera Widget to display a list of your recent Aside and Link posts (found in Appearance → Widgets) the title of your Link posts will point to the URL of the first link in your post instead of pointing back to the post on your blog.

The '''Gallery Format''' is meant for posts using the Gallery shortcode. Gallery posts will show a thumbnail from your galleries on Index pages.

The '''Status Format''' is for short personal updates. Each Status post will show the avatar of the post author alongside the content.

If you have a post that’s almost entirely a quote, the '''Quote Format''' will make those quotes stand out.

The '''Video Format''' is meant for posting a single video, which will appear with minimal post meta above the post to help your video content shine.

The '''Image Format''' is meant for posting one image and one image only. Here the post meta, seen below your post, is presented more like a caption for the post.

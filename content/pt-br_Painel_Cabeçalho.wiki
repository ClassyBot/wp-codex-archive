====Crop Header Image====
:The Crop Header Image feature allows you to select an area of an image and then delete all but that selected area.  When initially displayed, WordPress shows that maximum sized crop area in a lighter shade as represented by the northern third of the US States map in this example.  When using a theme such as the {{DefaultTheme}} the header image is expected to be 940 × 198 pixels so that is the size of the selected area shown.  You can click, hold, and drag the lighter crop selection area and down (or up) the image to the desired point.  Also, you can click one of the eight crop resizer boxes (little square box on each corner and each side) to move the crop selection area.

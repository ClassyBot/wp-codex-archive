Everyone eventually needs help. The [[Forum_Welcome|Support Forums welcome page]] is packed with information on where and what to post to ask for assistance.  This article is the <abbr title="Too ling, didn't read">TL;DR</abbr> version.

==Forum Topics==
Among the many ways to get WordPress help is the [https://wordpress.org/support/ Support Forums]. A well-written support request makes it easy for people to understand and assist you &mdash; saving you (and others) time.

Here's an example of a request that will not be effective:

<div class="wrapper" style="border: 1px solid #dadada; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em 0;">
<p class="col-12" style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.2em; margin-left: 0.7em;">Help</p>
<div class="col-3" style="line-height: 1.2em;">[[Image:Gravatar-_Mystery_Person-_small.png|left]]<small><b>wprox</b><br />Member<br />Posted 10 minutes ago</small></div>
<div class="col-6">My site is broken!</div>
<div class="wrapper" ></div>
</div>

What was wrong with that request? The user didn't provide any details; anyone wanting to help needs to know:
<ul>
	<li>What are the specific characteristics of the problem?</li>
	<li>What is the website address (URL)?</li>
	<li>What web browser (and browser version number) were you using to view the webpage? Did you view it it any other browser too?</li>
	<li>Was there an error message? (If so, include the text of the message.)</li>
	<li>Did you try any troubleshooting?</li>
</ul>

Answer those basic questions in your initial post. Start with a descriptive and specific title, then concisely explain the problem, including details on where you see this problem and what you've done to try to correct it:

<div class="wrapper" style="border: 1px solid #dadada; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em 0;">
<p class="col-12" style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.2em; margin-left: 0.7em;">Header loads in Chrome but not Firefox</p>
<div class="col-3" style="line-height: 1.2em;">[[Image:Gravatar-_Mystery_Person-_small.png|left]]<small><b>wprox</b><br />Member<br />Posted 10 minutes ago</small></div>
<div class="col-6">Hi. My site's header won't load on Chrome, but it works on Firefox.

My site is: <span style="color: #4ca6cf;"><nowiki>http://example.com</nowiki></span>

I'm using the Forever theme from the WordPress.org Themes Directory and running the latest version of WordPress: 4.1.

I tried deactivating all of my plugins, but that didn't help.

Any suggestions?</div>
<div class="wrapper" ></div>
</div>

So do not be afraid to ask for help. Legions of your fellow WordPress fans check the forums often; one likely has a solution for you. But before you post, ask yourself: "What information will this person need to help me?" Spending a couple extra minutes creating a great request will get you to resolution sooner.

[[Image:Forum-topic-resolved.png|right|Marking a forum post: "resolved"]]And once your issue has been settled, please mark your forum topic as Resolved, using the checkbox under the text entry field (labeled: "Mark this topic as resolved") or the dropdown (labeled: "This topic is") in the sidebar.

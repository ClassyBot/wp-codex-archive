<p>There are two parts to backing up your WordPress site: <b>Database</b> and <b>Files</b>. 
</p><p>This page talks about <b>Files</b> only; if you need to back up your WordPress database, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Backing_Up_Your_Database" title="Backing Up Your Database">Backing Up Your Database</a>.
</p><p>Your WordPress site consists of the following files:
</p>
<ul><li> WordPress Core Installation</li>
<li> WordPress Plugins</li>
<li> WordPress Themes</li>
<li> Images and Files</li>
<li> Javascripts, PHP scripts, and other code files</li>
<li> Additional Files and Static Web Pages</li></ul>
<p>Everything that has anything to do with the look and feel of your site is in a file somewhere and needs to be backed up.  Additionally, you must back up all of your files in your WordPress directory (including subdirectories) and your <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#.htaccess" title="Glossary"><tt>.htaccess</tt></a> file.  
</p><p>While most hosts back up the entire server, including your site, it is better that you back up your own files.  The easiest method is to use an <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/FTP_Clients" title="FTP Clients">FTP program</a> to download all of your WordPress files from your host to your local computer.
</p><p>By default, the files in the directory called wp-content are your own user-generated content, such as edited themes, new plugins, and uploaded files.  Pay particular attention to backing up this area, along with your wp-config.php, which contains your connection details.  The remaining files are mostly the core files, which are supplied by the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wordpress.org/download/">WordPress download zip file</a>.
</p><p>Please read <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Backups#Backing_Up_Your_WordPress_Site" title="WordPress Backups">Backing Up Your WordPress Site</a> for further information.
</p><p>Other ways to backup your files include:
</p>
<dl><dt>Website Host Provided Backup Software&#160;</dt>
<dd>Most website hosts provide software to back up your site. Check with your host to find out what services and programs they provide.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Create Synchs With Your Site&#160;</dt>
<dd> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php">WinSCP</a> and other programs allow you to synchronize with your website to keep a mirror copy of the content on your server and hard drive updated. It saves time and makes sure you have the latest files in both places.</dd></dl>
<p>To synchronize your files in WinScp -
</p>
<ol><li> Log in to your ftp server normally using WinScp.</li>
<li> Press the "Synchronize" button. <br />Remote directory will automatically be set to the current ftp directory (often your root directory).<br />Local directory would be set to the local directory as it was when you pressed Synchronize. You may want to change this to some other directory on your computer.<br />Direction should be set to "local" to copy files FROM your web host TO your machine.<br />Synchronization Mode would be set to Synchronize files.</li>
<li> Click "OK" to show a summary of actions.</li>
<li> click "OK" again to complete the synchronization.</li></ol>
<dl><dt>Copy Your Files to Your Desktop&#160;</dt>
<dd>Using <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/FTP_Clients" title="FTP Clients">FTP Clients</a> or <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/UNIX_Shell_Skills" title="UNIX Shell Skills">UNIX Shell Skills</a> you can copy the files to a folder on your computer. Once there, you can zip or compress them into a zip file to save space, allowing you to keep several versions.</dd></dl>
<p>Normally, there would be no need to copy the WordPress core files, as you can replace them from a fresh download of the WordPress zip file. The important files to back up would be your wp-config.php file, which contains your settings and your wp-content directory (plus its contents) which contains all your theme and plugin files

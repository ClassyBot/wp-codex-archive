WordPress Widgets can be converted to work with WordPress MU. As of WordPress 2.3 and WPMU 1.3, widgets support is built directly into WordPress and the WordPress Widgets Plugin is no longer required.

Examples of Widgets specifically for WordPress MU to use, learn, and study include:

* [[WPMU List All Blogs Widget]] 
* [[WPMU List New Blogs Widget]] 
* [[WPMU List All Postings Widget]]
* [http://mu.wordpress.org/forums/topic.php?id=2109&replies=2 About Me Widget]

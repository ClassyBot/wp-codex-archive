== Common questions ==


=== How does Akismet work? ===

Each time a new comment, trackback, or pingback is added to your site it's submitted to the Akismet web service which runs hundreds of tests on the comment and returns a thumbs up or thumbs down. As a result, you don't have to waste your time sorting through and deleting spammy comments from your blog.

=== Akismet thought my friend's comment was spam! ===

This is also called a "false positive," and is a comment that is not actually spam, but is mistakenly marked as so, since computers aren't perfect. That's okay, it's easy to unmark it and let it back into the stream of legitimate comments.

Go into your [[Administration Panels|administration panel]], and click "Comments" from the left menu options, and then click "Spam" at the top of the page.  Find the comment, and click on the "Not Spam" button. 

===Why can't I see all comments held as spam?===

Only one comment marked as spam is displayed per IP. The reasoning behind this is that if one comment from that IP is spam, the rest follow suit.  You can read more on the [http://wordpress.org/support/topic/52628 support forums] about this behavior.

===How do I submit missed spam?===

From the comments section of your administration panel, you simply mouse over the spam comment and click the red "spam" link. Marking the comment as spam will submit it to the Akismet servers. The comment will no longer display in the moderation queue or on your site, and it will be automatically deleted by the Akismet plugin after one month. When submitting previously not recognized spam to the Akismet service, Akismet will analyze the content and learn to recognize new spam patterns.

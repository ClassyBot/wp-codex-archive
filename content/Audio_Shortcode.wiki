The '''Audio''' feature allows you to embed audio files and play them back using a simple [[Shortcode]]. This was added as of WordPress [[Version 3.6|3.6]] and is used like this:

 [audio]

You can also use build in embeds and simply put the media file on it's own line:

<pre>
  My cool content

  http://my.mp3s.com/cool/songs/coolest.mp3

  More cool content
</pre>

== Usage ==

I have an old post that has an audio file in the Media Library attached to it, and I want to use the new shortcode: 

 [audio]

I have the URL for an MP3, from the Media Library or external, that I want to play: 

 [audio src="audio-source.mp3"]

I have a source URL and fallbacks for other HTML5-supported filetypes:

 [audio mp3="source.mp3" ogg="source.ogg" wav="source.wav"]

== Options ==

The following basic options are supported:

{{Parameter|src|string|The source of your audio file. If not included it will auto-populate with the first audio file attached to the post. You can use the following options to define specific filetypes, allowing for graceful fallbacks:<ul><li>'mp3', 'm4a', 'ogg', 'wav', 'wma'</li></ul>|optional|First audio file attached to the post}}

{{Parameter|loop|string|Allows for the looping of media.<ul><li>"off" - Do not loop the media.</li><li>"on" - Media will loop to beginning when finished and automatically continue playing.</li></ul>|optional|"off"}}

{{Parameter|autoplay|boolean|Causes the media to automatically play as soon as the media file is ready.<ul><li>0 - Do not automatically play the media.</li><li>1 - Media will play as soon as it is ready.</li></ul>|optional|0}}

{{Parameter|preload|string|Specifies if and how the audio should be loaded when the page loads. Defaults to "none".<ul><li>"none" - The audio should not be loaded when the page loads.</li><li>"auto" - The audio should be loaded entirely when the page loads.</li><li>"metadata" - Only metadata should be loaded when the page loads.</li></ul>|optional|"none"}}

== Source File ==

The audio shortcode is located in {{Trac|wp-includes/media.php}}.

==媒体设置==

;Image sizes : The sizes listed below determine the maximum dimensions in pixels to use when inserting an image into the body of a post.
:*'''Thumbnail size''' - Enter the '''Width''' and '''Height'''
::*'''Crop thumbnail to exact dimensions (normally thumbnails are proportional)''' - check box
:*'''Medium size''' - Enter the  '''Max Width''' and  '''Max Height''' 
:*'''Large size''' - Enter the  '''Max Width''' and  '''Max Height''' 

;Embeds : It's super easy to embed videos, images, and other content into your WordPress site, using what are known as [[Embeds]]. To embed something into a post or [[Pages|page]] is as simple as putting the URL to that video into your content area.  Make sure the URL is on its own line, and is not hyperlinked (clickable when viewing the post).  
:*'''Auto-embeds''' - '''Attempt to automatically embed all plain text URLs ''' - check box
:*'''Maximum embed size''' - Enter the '''Width''' and '''Height'''.  ''If the width value is left blank, embeds will default to the max width of your theme.''

;Uploading Files : Default settings used for during the media upload process when writing a post.
:*'''Store uploads in this folder''' - Enter the folder (directory) to where you want to upload files with the [[Administration_Screens|Administration]] > [[Administration Screens#Posts - Make some content|Posts]] > [[Posts Add New Screen|Add New]] Upload function.  You must enter a folder [[Glossary#Relative_Path|relative]] to your [[Settings_General_Screen|WordPress address (URI)]] folder.  WordPress suggests an upload directory of ''wp-content/uploads''.  Use the suggestion, or modify it to a [[Glossary#Relative_Path|relative path]] of your choice.  If your ''wp-content'' folder is [[Changing File Permissions|writeable]], WordPress will automatically create this folder when you do the first upload using the [[Administration_Screens|Administration]] > [[Administration Screens#Posts - Make some content|Posts]] > [[Posts Add New Screen|Add New]] Upload function.

:*'''Full URL path to files (optional)''' - Enter a URL path to your uploaded files.  This is optional only if the setting 'Store uploads in this folder' remains at its default value of wp-content/uploads. Otherwise it must include the full path to the upload file directory that a browser would see.

:*'''Organize my uploads into month- and year-based folders''' -  Check this box if you wish to organize your uploads into folders based on the year and the month of the upload.  Assuming that you have specified ''wp-content/uploads'' as your upload storage folder, if you check this box, a file uploaded in June of 2010 would be placed into the ''wp-content/uploads/2010/06'' folder.  Note: At the time of the actual upload, WordPress will automatically create the folders, such as ''wp-content/uploads/2010'' and ''wp-content/uploads/2010/06'', as long as your ''wp-content'' folder is [[Changing File Permissions|writeable]].

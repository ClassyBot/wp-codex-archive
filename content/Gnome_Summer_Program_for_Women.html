<p>Projects can be proposed in any of the areas of contribution listed below. The best way to pick a solid project idea is to discuss it with one or more potential mentors for feedback. Your own ideas are very encouraged; consider these project ideas as jumping off points for your involvement. You can also feel free to propose a project that includes more than one area of contribution; we're a collaborative project community by habit, so it's easy enough to have multiple mentors on a project as needed. 
</p><p>Note: We are a little behind on filling in these ideas due to other coinciding deadlines, but we'd love to talk to potential applicants about project ideas. We'll be filling in more ideas over the next couple of days, but can also be contacted in irc on freenode channel #wordpress-contribute, or via the Ask a  Question form at the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://make.wordpress.org/community/ask-a-question/">community team blog</a>.

<p>Following the format used in our Troubleshooting workshop, create workshop content for other areas of WordPress experience/knowledge including but not limited to: theme creation, plugin development, core contribution, using multisite, setting up a new WP site (including niche setups), advanced WP feature use, etc. Exact curriculums will be based on your interestes and experience/qualifications.

<p>If you are an organizational wizard with event planning and/or marketing experience, we have any number of potential projects that might be a fit. Between WordCamps, Meetups, the Contributor Summit, and the WordPress.org site, there are endless possibilities. 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Community_Management">Community Management</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/index.php?title=Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20" title="Edit section: Community Management">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>We have only recently developed an official structure of contributor groups, and there are two potential projects. 
</p><p>-- Day-to-day community management. Create and manage a schedule of ongoing group activity tracking and reporting, monitor social media channels, interact with community volunteers.
</p><p>-- Diversity Measurement. Help with initiating some opt-in profile data collection to measure community diversity. Create/execute/analyze a community survey on diversity, contributor experience, economic impact, etc. Background in academic social sciences preferred.
</p><p>Mentor for either project would be Jen Mylo, and there would be interaction with Team Reps from all contributor groups. Experience managing groups/departments helpful, as is experience with survey design and stats collection and analysis.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="QA">QA</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/index.php?title=Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21" title="Edit section: QA">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>We could really use a formal QA program. We do unit testing and usablity testing currently, but a regular old QA program with scripted QA flows/tests that beta users could do at home to participate via a beta testers/QA plugin would be ideal. Putting together this initiative would require QA experience. Would also work with a developer who would implement any needed plugin functionality to enable useful reporting. 
</p>

<p>There are a number of design projects that could be assigned, but this area more than any other depends on the applicant's portfolio since we work within a pretty specific brand. Site designs, swag designs, print materials, and more are all in the mix for the right person.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="BuddyPress">BuddyPress</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/index.php?title=Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23" title="Edit section: BuddyPress">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>If you fancy something different and want to be involved in a social plugin then you could consider getting involved with BuddyPress. There are a few potential projects for anyone wanting to be part of this:
</p>
<ul><li> Copy and documentation for the buddypress.org site&#160;: The codex needs some love and the copy on the site could be helped. You may want to tackle the codex or wrestle tutorials.</li>
<li> There are a number of development tasks proposed for the Google Summer of Code application that could be tackled by someone under this program: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://codex.buddypress.org/gsoc2013/">http://codex.buddypress.org/gsoc2013/</a></li></ul>

<p>Sounds like at least one of these projects is right up your alley? We have many contributors willing to mentor a project for this program, so figuring out what you want your project to be will really be the biggest determining factor in who should be your mentor (and in most cases, we will assign 2 mentors just to make sure you get the attention you need). If you have any questions about the application, want to know who might mentor a particular project, or have a general question about participating with WordPress, hop into the freenode irc channel #wordpress-contribute, or get in touch via the Ask a  Question form at the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://make.wordpress.org/community/ask-a-question/">community team blog</a>.
</p><p>Good luck!

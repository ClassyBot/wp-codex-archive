==Add New User==
In this Screen, you may add new Users to your site.  If the '''Anyone can register''' option is set in the Membership section of [[Administration_Screens|Administration]] > [[Administration_Screens#General|Settings]] > [[Settings_General_Screen|General]], users can register themselves at <nowiki>http://your wordpress url/wp-register.php</nowiki>.  Regardless of that setting, you can manually create new users here.
:*'''Username (required)''' -  Enter the username of the new user here.  This will also be used as the '''Login''' name of the new user.
:*'''E-mail (required)''' -  Enter a valid e-mail address of the new user here. The e-mail address must be unique for each user.  If a published post or page is authored by this user, then when approved comments are made to that post or page, a notification e-mail is sent to this e-mail address.  
:*'''First Name''' -  Enter the first name of the new user here.
:*'''Last Name''' - Enter the last name of the new user in this text box (the display name defaults to first and last name).
:*'''Website''' -:  You may enter the new user's website URL in this text box.
:*'''Password (twice)''' - Enter a password for the new user twice here, once in each text box.
:: '''Strength Indicator'''  This indicates if the password you entered is Very Weak, Weak, Medium, or Strong (displayed in green).  The stronger the password the more secure the login.  Hint: The password should be at least seven characters long. To make it stronger, use upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols like ''!"?$%^&)''.
:*'''Send Password?''' - Check the box to '''Send this password to the new user by email'''.
:*'''Role''' -  Select the desired [[Roles and Capabilities|Role]] for this User from the drop-down box. Default: [[Administration Screens|Administration]] > [[Administration Screens#Settings - Configuration Settings|Settings]] > [[Settings_General_Screen|General]] - New User Default Role
:*'''Add New User''' -  Click this important button to save the new user's information into WordPress' database.  If you don't click this button, the user will not be added.  A flash message at the top of the screen will advise you that the new user has been added.

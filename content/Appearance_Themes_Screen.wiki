==Appearance &rarr; Themes==

The [[Appearance Themes Screen]] allows you to manage your Themes. That means you can install, preview, delete Themes, activate, and update Themes. 

A WordPress Theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a weblog. These files are called [[Templates|'''template files''']]. A Theme modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying the underlying software. Themes may include customized template files, image files (<tt>*.jpg</tt>, <tt>*.gif</tt>), style sheets (<tt>*.css</tt>), custom [[Pages]], as well as any necessary code files (<tt>*.php</tt>). For an introduction to template files, see [[Stepping Into Templates]].

===Install Themes===
Themes can be installed in several ways:

You can find additional themes for your site from the [http://wordpress.org/themes/ WordPress Theme Directory]. These themes are designed and developed by third parties, are available free of charge, and are compatible with the license WordPress uses.

====Using the upload method====
[[Image:appearance-install-theme-manual-step1.png|400px|right|Download the Theme ZIP file]]
The upload method is another easy way to install a Theme. This can be used to install any Theme that is in a ZIP file. All the Themes in the [http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/ WordPress Theme Directory] can be installed using this method.
Download the ZIP file. First find the Theme you want to install. The screenshot shows the [http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/p2 P2 theme] ready to be downloaded. Various other sources of Themes can be used and the key is to download the Theme ZIP file to your local computer. Place the file anywhere convenient.

[[Image:appearance-install-theme-manual-step2.png|400px|right|Upload and Install Now]]
Visit [[Administration_Screens|Administration]] > [[Administration_Screens#Themes|Appearance]] > [[Appearance_Themes_Screen|Themes]], click the Add New button, then click the Upload Theme link. Click '''Browse''' button and specify the ZIP file you downloaded in above step and click Install Now.

The Install Theme from uploaded file will display the results of the installation. Click the '''Activate''' link to make that the Current Theme.

====Using the FTP method====
It is unlikely that it would be necessary to use the FTP method of installing a Theme, but if necessary follow these steps.

# Download the Theme files to your local computer. If the Theme is in ZIP file archive and extract the ZIP file contents to a folder on your local computer. You may need to preserve the directory structure in the archive when extracting these files. Follow the guidelines provided by your Theme author.
# Using an [[FTP_Clients|FTP client]] to access your host web server. If necessary create a directory to contain your Theme in the <tt>wp-content/themes</tt> directory provided by WordPress. For example, a Theme named '''Test''' should be in <tt>wp-content/themes/test</tt>. Your Theme may provide this directory as part of the archive.
# Upload the Theme files to the new directory on your host server.
# Visit [[Administration_Screens|Administration]] > [[Administration_Screens#Themes|Appearance]] > [[Appearance_Themes_Screen|Themes]],  if necessary navigate to the page displaying that Theme, then click the Activate link to make the Theme, the Current Theme.

====Installing with cPanel====
If your host offers the [[Glossary#cPanel|cPanel]] control panel, and the Theme files are in a .zip or .gz archive follow these instructions. 
# Download the Theme ZIP file to your local machine.
# In cPanel File Manager, navigate to your Themes folder. If you have WordPress installed in it's own folder called wordpress, you would navigate to "public_html/wordpress/wp-content/themes" and if WordPress is installed in your web-root folder you would navigate to "public_html/wp-content/themes".
# Once you've navigated to the Themes folder in cPanel File Manager, click on Upload file(s) and upload that ZIP file you saved in Step 1.
#Once the ZIP file is uploaded, click on the ZIP file name in cPanel, then in the panel to the right, click on Extract File Contents, and that ZIP file will be uncompressed.
# Visit [[Administration_Screens|Administration]] > [[Administration_Screens#Themes|Appearance]] > [[Appearance_Themes_Screen|Themes]], if necessary navigate to the page displaying that Theme, then click the Activate link to make the Theme, the Current Theme.

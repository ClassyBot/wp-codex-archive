==Prerequisites==

The supported operating systems for the Web PI 3.0 are Windows 7, Windows Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1), Windows Vista, Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) and later versions, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 (SP1) and later versions.

For this guide, it is assumed that you have Windows Server 2008 R2 installed on your computer. You will also need an Internet connection and administrator privileges for your computer.

It is a good idea to confirm that your system meets the hardware requirements for IIS 7.0. See http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc268240.aspx for more information.

==Step 1. Install the Web Platform Installer 3.0==

In this step, you begin to install the Web PI 3.0, which is a 1.3 MB download.

# Log on to Windows Server 2008 R2 as a user who has administrative privileges.
# Start Windows Internet Explorer.
# Go to http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx, and then click '''Download It Now'''.<br/>[[Image:Microsoft_Web_Platform_Installer_3.0_webpage.png|Microsoft Web Platform Installer 3.0 webpage]]
# Click '''Run'''.<br/>[[Image:File_Download_Security_Warning_1.png|File download security warning]]
# Click '''Run''' again.<br/>[[Image:Internet_Explorer_Security_Warning_2.png|Internet Explorer security warning]]
# Wait a few seconds for the Web PI 3.0 to start.

==Step 2. Select the products and applications to install==

In this step, you select the version of WordPress that you want to install. WordPress 3.0.3 is used in this guide.

# Next to '''WordPress''', click '''Add'''.<br/>'''Note:''' If WordPress is not in the items list, click '''Applications''' in the left navigation pane.<br/>[[Image:Application_selection.png|Application selection]]
# Click '''Install'''.<br/>[[Image:Application_selection_2.png|Application selection (continued)]]

==Step 3. Review and configure the selected products and applications==

In this step, you review and configure what you have added. Additionally, you add the database, name the MySQL database, and name the WordPress 3.0.3 site.

# When you are asked which type of database you want to use, leave '''MySQL''' selected.<br/>'''Note:''' This will install MySQL 5.1 for Windows to handle all the database transactions that are required by WordPress.
# In the list, select '''Install it on my machine''', and then click '''Continue'''.<br/>[[Image:Database_engine_selection.png|Database engine selection]]
# Scroll down to confirm that all the following items have been automatically included as dependencies:
#* IIS 7.0
#* PHP 5.3.5
#* IIS URL Rewrite 2.0
#* Windows Cache Extension 1.1 for PHP 5.3
#* MySQL 5.1 for Windows<br/>'''Note:''' Windows Cache Extension is used to increase the speed of PHP applications that are running on your web host. IIS URL Rewrite allows “Pretty Permalinks” to be enabled for WordPress.
# Review the files to be downloaded and installed, as well as the license agreements, and then click '''I Accept'''.<br/>[[Image:Application_installation_summary.png|Application installation summary]]
# Specify a password for the MySQL administrator user name (root), and then click '''Continue'''.<br/>'''Note:''' It is important to remember this password because you will be asked for this password in the steps that follow.<br/>[[Image:MySQL_root_password_setup.png|MySQL root password setup]]
# Allow the Web PI installation to complete.

# Leave '''Create new database''' selected.
# Type the database administrator user name (root) and password.<br/>'''Note:''' This account is used to create and manage the database that is needed for WordPress.<br/>[[Image:Application_configuration.png|Application configuration]]
# Type the database user name.<br/>'''Note''' WordPress will use this account to access and write to the database as needed.
# Type the password for the database user name.
# Leave the default database server name, '''localhost'''.<br/>[[Image:Application_configuration_continued.png|Application configuration (continued)]]
# You may customize the name of the WordPress database as desired.
# Use the WordPress key generator at http://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/ to generate four unique keys, and then copy the keys into the following fields:
#* '''Unique Key for Passwords'''
#* '''Unique Key for Secure Passwords'''
#* '''Unique Key for Authentication'''
#* '''Second Unique Key for Authentication'''<br/>'''Note:''' You will not be required to recall these keys later.
# Click '''Continue'''.<br/>[[Image:Application_configuration_continued_2.png|Application configuration (continued)]]

# In the '''Save As''' dialog box, browse to C:\intepub\wwwroot\myWordPress.<br/>'''Note:''' This step assumes that you named the WordPress site myWordPress during installation. If you used a different name, use that name instead of myWordPress.
# In the '''File name''' box, type '''web.config'''.
# In the '''Save as type''' box, click '''All Files'''.
# Click '''Save''', and then close Notepad.<br/>[[Image:Save_As_dialog_box.png|Save As dialog box]]

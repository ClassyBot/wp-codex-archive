==Description==
WordPress allows theme and plugin developers to programmatically specify new, custom rewrite rules. The following functions (which are mostly aliases for [[Function_Reference/WP_Rewrite|WP_Rewrite]] methods) can be used to achieve this. 

Note that these rules are usually called inside the <code>init</code> hook. Furthermore, permalinks will need to be refreshed (you can do this from your admin under (Settings > Permalinks) before the rewrite changes will take effect.  Requires one-time use of flush_rules() to take effect. See also [[Function_Reference/register_post_type#Flushing_Rewrite_on_Activation|Flushing Rewrite on Activation]].

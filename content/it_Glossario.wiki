Questo documento ha lo scopo di offrire le definizioni di vari termini, esclusivi di WordPress, con cui gli utenti potrebbero non avere familiarità.

Se vuoi contribuire <b>per favore</b> non aggiungere definizioni per termini generici (API, PHP, JavaScript, ecc...).

== Percorso assoluto ==
Un '''percorso assoluto''' o '''percorso completo''' è la posizione univoca di un file o una cartella all'interno di un computer o filesystem, e solitamente inizia con la cartella radice o la lettera di un'unità di lettura. Le cartelle e le sottocartelle elencate in un percorso sono solitamente separate da una barra (''/'').

Esempio: ''/Users/Matt/www/blog/images/icecream.jpg''
<!-- Windows: C:\Windows\... ?? -->

Per trovare il pecorso assoluto nel filesystem della cartella che contiene una pagina web, copiare il codice qui sotto in un nuovo file di testo, salvarlo come ''path.php'' (in questo modo si crea una semplice pagina web PHP), e spostare quel file nel proprio [[#Web Server|web server]]. Poi scrivere nella barra degli indirizzi del proprio browser l'[[#URL|URL]] di quel file (es. ''http://www.example.com/path.php'').

  <?php
  $p = getcwd();
  echo $p;
  ?>

== URI assoluto ==
Un URI [[#Percorso assoluto|completo]].

  <nowiki>http://www.example.com/blog/images/icecream.jpg</nowiki>
  <nowiki>ftp://ftp.example.com/users/h/harriet/www/</nowiki>

== Azione ==
In WordPress un'azione è una [http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_functions.asp funzione PHP] che viene eseguita in specifici punti in tutto il codice di WordPress.

Gli sviluppatori possono creare un'azione <b>personalizzata</b> usando le [[it:Riferimento funzioni/add_action|API delle azioni]] per aggiungere o rimuovere codice da un'azione esistente specificando qualunque [[Plugin_API/Action_Reference|aggancio esistente]]. Questo processo è chiamato "[[#Hook|aggancio]]".

<b>For example:</b> A developer may want to <b>add</b> code to the footer of a Theme. This could be accomplished by writing new function, then Hooking it to the [[Plugin API/Action Reference/wp_footer|wp_footer]] Action.

<b>Custom Actions differ from custom ''[[#Filter|Filters]]''</b> because custom Actions allow you to <b>add or remove</b> code from existing Actions. Whereas custom Filters allow you to <b>replace</b> specific data (such as a variable) found within an existing Action.

== Admin Bar ==
The '''admin bar''' is an area of the screen just above your site that lists useful admininstration screen links such as add a new post or edit your profile.  The admin bar concept was added to WordPress in [[Version 3.1]] and was replaced by the [[Toolbar]] in WordPress [[Version 3.3]]. Each user can use [[Administration_Panels|Administration]] > [[Administration_Panels#Your_Profile|Users]] > [[Users_Your_Profile_SubPanel|Your Profile]] to turn on (or off) the admin bar when viewing the site or the Dashboard.

== AJAX ==
'''AJAX''' is a technique that web pages use to have the server perform certain processing without reloading the web page. For example, when you approve a comment in a WordPress blog, WordPress uses AJAX to change the comment's status, and you see the change without having to reload the Comments screen.

== Apache ==
'''Apache''' è l'abbreviazione di '''[http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache HTTP Server Project]''', un software [[#Web server|web server]] open source robusto, di tipo commerciale, ricco di funzioni e disponibile gratuitamente realizzato dalla [http://www.apache.org/ Apache Software Foundation]. È uno dei web server più utilizzati su Internet ed è disponibile su varie piattaforme, compreso Windows, [[#Unix|Unix]]/[[#Linux|Linux]] e [[#Mac OS X|Mac OS X]]. Apache  è la base più utilizzata per la pubblicazione di siti basati su WordPress.

== [http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface API] ==
Si faccia riferimento a Wikipedia per una definizione (cliccare sul titolo che è un link a quella pagina).

== Array ==
An '''array''' is one of the basic data structures used in computer programming.  An ''array'' contains a list (or ''vector'') of items such as numeric or string values.  ''Arrays'' allow programmers to randomly access data.  Data can be stored in either ''one-dimensional'' or ''multi-dimensional arrays''.

A one-dimension array seven (7) elements would be:
{| border="1" cellpadding="3" style="border-color: #ccc; border-collapse: collapse; margin-bottom: 1em"
!105!!200!!54!!53!!102!!13!!405
|}
The [[Template Tags|Template Tag]] [[Template Tags/wp list categories|<tt>wp_list_categories()</tt>]] uses a one-dimensional array for the 'exclude' parameter.

An example of two-dimensional array, 7 by 3 elements in size, would be:
{| border="1" cellpadding="3" style="border-color: #ccc; border-collapse: collapse; margin-bottom: 1em"
!105!!200!!54!!53!!102!!13!!405
|-
!15!!210!!14!!513!!2!!2313!!4512
|-
!501!!500!!499!!488!!552!!75!!1952
|}

== ASCII ==
'''ASCII''' (pronounced as "ask ee") is a standard but limited [[#Character_set|character set]] containing only English letters, numbers, a few common symbols, and common English punctuation marks. WordPress [[#Content|content]] is not restricted to ASCII, but can include any [[#Unicode|Unicode]] characters.

ASCII is short for '''A'''merican '''S'''tandard '''C'''ode for '''I'''nformation '''I'''nterchange.

==Back End==
The back end is the area that authorized users can sign into to add, remove and modify content on the website. This may also be referred to as “WordPress”, "admin" or “the administration area”.

[[#top|Torna in cima]]

== Binaries ==
'''Binaries''' refer to compiled computer programs, or executables. Many [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source open source] projects, which can be re-compiled from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code source code], offer pre-compiled binaries for the most popular platforms and operating systems.

[[#top|Torna in cima]]

== Blog ==
A '''blog''', or '''weblog''', is an online journal, diary, or serial published by a person or group of people.

Blogs are typically used by individuals or peer groups, but are occasionally used by companies or organizations as well. In the corporate arena, the only adopters of the blog format so far have tended to be design firms, web media companies, and other "bleeding edge" tech firms.

Blogs often contain public as well as private content. Depending on the functionality of the [[#Content Management System|CMS]] software that is used, some authors may restrict access &mdash; through the use of accounts or passwords &mdash; to content that is too personal to be published publicly.

[[#top|Torna in cima]]

== Blogging ==
'''Blogging''' is the act of writing in one's blog. To ''blog'' something is to write about something in one's blog. This sometimes involves [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink linking] to something the author finds interesting on the internet.

* See also: [[#Blogosphere|Blogosphere]], [[#Blogroll|Blogroll]]

[[#top|Torna in cima]]

== Blogosphere ==
Il '''blogosphere''' è il sottoinsieme di siti web che sono, o sono legati a, [[#Blog|blog]].

* Si veda anche: [[#Blog|Blog]], [[#Blogroll|Blogroll]]

[[#top|Torna in cima]]

== Blogroll ==
Un '''blogroll''' è una lista di collegamenti a vari blog o siti di notizie. Spesso un blogroll è "rolled" da un servizio che traccia gli agiornamenti (usando i [[#Feed|feed]]) ad ogni sito nella lista, e fornisce la lista in una forma che aggrega le informazioni di aggiornamento. Il blogroll predefinito (noto anche come Link) incluso in WordPress è stato rimosso a partire dalla versione 3.5.

== Bookmarklet ==
A '''bookmarklet''' (or '''favelet''') is a "faux" bookmark containing scripting code, usually written in [[#JavaScript|JavaScript]], that allows the user to perform a function.

[[#top|Torna in cima]]

* Examples
** The WordPress [[Press This]] bookmarklet allows a user to quickly blog whichever web site he/she is currently viewing.
** The [http://delicious.com/help/bookmarklets delicious.com bookmarklets] allow a user to quickly post a link to his/her delicious.com bookmarks list.

[[#top|Torna in cima]]

== Categoria ==
Ogni [[#Post|post]] in WordPress è archiviato dentro una '''categoria'''. Una categorizzazione ragionata consente ai post di essere raggruppati assieme ad altri aventi contenuti simili e aiuta nella navigazione di un sito. Si noti che la ''categoria di un post'' non deve essere confusa con le [[Administration_Panels#Link Categories|categorie dei link]] usate per classificare e gestire i [[Administration_Panels#Links_-_Putting_the_Inter_in_the_Internet|collegamenti]].

[[#top|Torna in cima]]

== Capabilities ==
A '''capability''' is permission to perform one or more types of task. Each user of a WordPress site might have some permissions but not others, depending on their [[#Role|role]]. For example, users who have the Author role usually have permission to edit their own posts (the "edit_posts" capability), but not permission to edit other users' posts (the "edit_others_posts" capability). WordPress comes with six roles and over fifty capabilities in its role-based access system. Plugins can modify the system.

==CGI==
'''CGI''' (Common Gateway Interface) is a specification for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side server-side] communication scripts designed to transfer information between a [[#Web server|web server]] and a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side web-client (browser)].  Typically, [[#HTML|HTML]] pages that collect data via forms use ''CGI'' programming to process the form data once the client submits it.

[[#top|Torna in cima]]

==Character Entity ==
A '''character entity''' is a method used to display ''special characters'' normally ''reserved'' for use in [[#HTML|HTML]].  For example, the ''less than'' ('''&lt;''') and ''greater than'' ('''&gt;''') are used as part the [[#HTML|HTML]] tag structure, so both symbols are ''reserved'' for that use.  But, if you need to display those symbols on your site, you can use ''character entities''.  For example:

:use '''<code>&amp;lt;</code>'''&nbsp;&nbsp;for the less than (&lt;) symbol
:use '''<code>&amp;gt;</code>'''&nbsp;&nbsp;for the greater than (&gt;) symbol

<span id="Character_set"></span><!-- core uses this. oops. -->
==Character Set ==
A '''character set''' is a collection of symbols (letters, numbers, punctuation, and special characters), when used together, represent meaningful words in a language.  Computers use an encoding scheme so members of a character set are stored with a numeric value (e.g. 0=A, 1=B, 2=C, 3=D).  In addition, a [[#Collation|collation]] determines the order (i.e alphabetic) to use when sorting the character set.

By default, WordPress uses the Unicode UTF-8 ('''utf8''') character set for the [[Database Description|WordPress MySQL database tables]] created during the [[Installing WordPress|installation process]].  Beginning with [[Version 2.2]], the database character set (and collation) is defined in the ''wp-config.php'' file.  Also note, the character set used for syndication feeds is set in the [[Administration_Panels|Administration]] > [[Administration_Panels#Reading|Settings]] > [[Settings_Reading_SubPanel|Reading]] panel.

== Classe ==
Le '''classi''' sono raggruppamenti di stili [[#CSS|CSS]] che possono essere applicati a qualunque elemento [[#HTML|HTML]].
Per le classi in PHP, si veda l'articolo [[http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_(informatica)|Classe (informatica))]] su Wikipedia e [http://php.net/manual/it/language.oop5.php Manuale PHP: Classi e Oggetti].

[[#top|Torna in cima]]

== Collation ==
'''Collation''' refers to the order used to sort the letters, numbers, and symbols of a given [[#Character set|character set]].  For example, because WordPress, by default, uses the UTF-8 ('''utf8''') character set, and when the [[Database Description|WordPress MySQL database tables]] are created during the [[Installing WordPress|installation process]], MySQL assigns '''utf8_general_ci''' collation to those tables.  Beginning with [[Version 2.2]], the collation (and character set) used by WordPress is defined in the ''wp-config.php'' file.

== Commenti ==
I '''comments''' sono una caratteristica dei [[#Blog|blog]] che permette ai lettori di rispondere ai [[#Post|post]]. Tipicamente i lettori forniscono semplicemente il loro pensiero riguardo il [[#Content|contenuto]] del post, ma gli utenti possono anche fornire [http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegamento_ipertestuale collegamenti] ad altre risorse, generare discussioni, o semplicemente compimentarsi con l'autore per aver scritto bene un post.

&Egrave; possibile controllare e regolare i commenti attrvareso filtri per lingua e contenuto. I commenti possono essere accodati per essere approvati prima di diventare visibili sul sito. Ciò è utile quando ha a che fare con lo [[Comment Spam|spam nei commenti]].

== Content ==
'''Content''' consists of text, images, or other information shared in [[#Post|posts]]. This is separate from the structural design of a web site, which provides a framework into which the content is inserted, and the presentation of a site, which involves graphic design. A [[#Content Management System|Content Management System]] changes and updates content, rather than the structural or graphic design of a web site.

[[#top|Torna in cima]]

== Content Management System ==
A '''Content Management System''', or '''CMS''', is software for facilitating the maintenance of [[#Content|content]], but not design, on a web site. A [[#Blog|blogging]] tool is an example of a Content Management System.

== CSS ==
'''CSS''', or '''Cascading Style Sheets''', is a [http://www.w3.org/ W3C] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard open standards] programming language for specifying how a web page is presented. It allows web site designers to create formatting and layout for a web site independently of its content.

== CVS ==
'''CVS''' sta per '''Concurrent Versions System''' ed è il software che veniva usato per coordinare lo sviluppo di WordPress. A partire da febbario 2005, questa funzione è effettuata da Subversion ([[#SVN|SVN]]).

Per maggiori informazioni su Subversion, si veda [[Usare Subversion]].

== Bacheca ==
In WordPress una '''bacheca''' è la principale schermata di amministrazione per un sito, o per una rete di siti. Riassume le informazioni relative al sito o la rete, e anche informazioni esterne, in uno o più [[#Widget|widget]] che l'utente della bacheca può abilitare, disabilitare e spostare.

== Database ==
A '''database''' in computing terms is software used to manage information in an organized fashion. [[#WordPress|WordPress]] uses the [[#MySQL|MySQL]] relational database management system for storing and retrieving the content of your [[#Blog|blog]], such as [[#Posts|posts]], [[#Comments|comments]], and so on.

* Related articles: [[Database Description]], [[Backing Up Your Database]]

[[#top|Torna in cima]]

== Database version ==
In WordPress, the '''database version''' is a number that increases every time changes are made to the way WordPress organizes the data in its [[#database|database]]. It is not the same as the version of the database software, [[#MySQL|MySQL]].

For example, the database version in WordPress 3.3 was 19470, and the database version in WordPress 3.3.1 did not change. This tells anyone planning to use backed-up data from the older version that they do not need to check for changes in the structure of the data.

WordPress stores its database version in the database, as the option named "db_version" in every WordPress site's "wp_options" table. (The table name prefix "wp_" may be missing or different in some cases.)

== Tema predefinito ==
Every installation of WordPress has a [[#Default theme|default theme]].  The default theme is sometimes called the '''fallback theme''', because if the active theme is for some reason lost or deleted, WordPress will fallback to using the default theme.

The WordPress default themes have been:

* Up to [[Version 2.9.2]] the default theme was the WordPress Default theme (sometimes called Kubrick) and was located in the ''wp-content/themes/default'' folder.  
* [[Version 3.0]] - the [[#Twenty Ten theme|Twenty Ten theme]]
* [[Version 3.2]] - the [[#Twenty Eleven theme|Twenty Eleven theme]] 
* [[Version 3.5]] - the [[#Twenty Twelve theme|Twenty Twelve theme]]
* [[Version 3.6]] - the [[#Twenty Thirteen theme|Twenty Thirteen theme]]

== DNS ==
<b>DNS</b>, the domain name system, is the system that maps [[#Domain_name|domain names]] to [[#IP_address|IP addresses]]. When you use a web browser to visit a website, your browser first extracts the site's domain name from the URL. Then it uses the DNS to find the IP address for that domain name. Then it connects to that IP address.

== DOM ==
'''DOM''' (Document Object Model) is a standard, platform-independent interface that allows programmers to dynamically access HTML and XML to control the content and structure of documents.  DOM connects programming scripts to web pages.

[[#top|Torna in cima]]

== Dominio ==
Un '''dominio''' è un nome usato per scopi di identificazione su Internet. In WordPress un dominio solitamente identifica un server su cui WordPress è installato. Per fare ciò, il sistema di nomi a dominio di Internet ([[#DNS|DNS]]) mappa il nome del dominio all[[Glossario#Indirizzo IP|indirizzo IP]] di un server. Per esempio, il dominio ''example.com'' mappa l'indirizzo IP ''192.0.43.10''. Molti nomi a dominio possono mappare lo stesso indirizzo IP, facendo sì che su un singolo server possano risiedere più siti web. Per esempio, i nomi a dominio ''www.example.com'' e ''example.net'' mappano entrambi l'indirizzo IP ''192.0.43.10''.

== Bozza ==
The '''draft''' [[#Post status|post status]] is for WordPress [[#Post|posts]] which are saved, but as yet unpublished. A draft post can only be edited through the [[Administration Panels|Administration Panel]], [[Write Post SubPanel]] by [[Authors and Users SubPanel#Table of Authors|users]] of equal or greater [[User Levels|User Level]] than the [[Authors and Users SubPanel#Table of Registered Users|post's author]].

[[#top|Torna in cima]]

== Excerpt ==
An '''excerpt''' is a condensed description of your blog [[#Post|post]] and refers to the summary entered in the Excerpt field of the [[Administration_Panels|Administration]] > [[Administration_Panels#Add_New_Post|Posts]] > [[Posts_Add_New_SubPanel|Add New SubPanel]].  The ''excerpt'' is used to describe your post in RSS feeds and is typically used in displaying search results. The ''excerpt'' is sometimes used in displaying the '''Archives''' and [[#Category|Category]] views of your posts.  Use the [[Template Tags|Template Tag]] [[Template Tags/the excerpt|<tt>the_excerpt()</tt>]] to display the contents of this field.  Note that if you do not enter information into the Excerpt field when writing a post, and you use [[Template Tags/the excerpt|<tt>the_excerpt()</tt>]] in your theme template files, WordPress will automatically display the first 55 words of the [[#Post|post]]'s content.

An ''excerpt'' should not be confused with the '''teaser''', which refers to words before the %%%<!--more-->%%% in a [[#Post|post's]] content. When typing a long post you can insert the %%%<!--more-->%%% [[Posts_Add_New_SubPanel#Visual_Versus_HTML_Editor|Quicktag]] after a few sentences to act as a cut-off point.  When the post is displayed, the '''teaser''', followed by a hyperlink (such as '''Read the rest of this entry...'''), is displayed.  Your visitor can then click on that link to see the full version of your [[#Post|post]]. The [[Template Tags|Template Tag]], [[Template Tags/the content|<tt>the_content()</tt>]] should be used to display the teaser.

== Feed ==
A '''feed''' is a function of special software that allows "Feedreaders" to access a site automatically looking for new content and then posting the information about new content and updates to another site. This provides a way for users to keep up with the latest and hottest information posted on different blogging sites.  Some Feeds include RSS (alternately defined as "Rich Site Summary" or "Really Simple Syndication"), Atom or RDF files.  Dave Shea, author of the web design weblog [http://mezzoblue.com Mezzoblue] has written [http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/05/19/what_is_rssx/ a comprehensive summary] of feeds.  Feeds generally are based on [[#XML|XML]] technology.

== Filter ==
In WordPress, a Filter is a [http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_functions.asp function] that is associated with an existing [[#Action|Action]] by specifying any [http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference existing Hook].

Developers can create [http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter <b>custom</b> Filters] using the [http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference Filter API] to <b>replace</b> code from an existing Action. This process is called "[[#Hook|hooking]]".

<b>Custom Filters differ from custom ''[[#Action|Actions]]''</b> because custom Actions allow you to <b>add or remove</b> code from existing Actions. Whereas custom Filters allow you to <b>replace</b> specific data (such as a variable) found within an existing Action.

== Footer area ==
A '''footer area''' is a horizontal area provided by a [[#Theme|theme]] for displaying information other than the main [[#Content|content]] of the web page. Themes may provide one or more footer areas below the content. Footer areas usually contain [[#Widget|widgets]] that an administrator of the site can customize.

In a theme, footer areas are generated by a [[#Template|template]] file, typically named ''sidebar-footer.php''.

== FTP ==
'''FTP''', or '''File Transfer Protocol''', is rather predictably, a client-server protocol for transferring files. It is one way to download files, and the most common way to upload files to a server.

An FTP ''client'' is a program which can download files from, or upload files to, an FTP ''server''.

You may need to use an FTP client to upload your WordPress files to your [[#Web server|web server]], particularly if you use a [[#Hosting provider|hosting provider]].

== Gallery ==
As defined by Andy Skelton, '''Gallery''', introduced with [[Version 2.5|WordPress 2.5]], is specifically an exposition of images attached to a post.  In that same vein, an upload is "attached to a post" when you upload it while editing a post.

In the uploader there is a "Gallery" tab that shows all the uploads attached to the post you are editing. When you have more than one attachment in a post, you should see at the bottom of the Gallery tab a button marked "Insert gallery". That button inserts a shortcode "[gallery]" into the post. WordPress replaces that shortcode with an exposition of all images attached to that post. Non-image file types are excluded from the gallery.

Note: If you don't see the "Insert gallery" button, it may be because you have not attached two images to the post.

The pretty URLs for attachments are made only after you have published the post and should be composed as the post [[#permalink|permalink]] plus the attachment [[#slug|slug]].

== gettext ==
The '''gettext''' system is a set of tools and standards for language translation, used by WordPress to provide versions in many languages. In WordPress a text string for translation may have a domain and a context. For example, a plugin might specify its own domain for translations, and a context might help translators to provide different translations of the same English word or phrase in different parts of the user interface.

'''GMT''' ("Greenwich Mean Time", the time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England) is the old name of the time zone from which all other time zones were measured. It has been replaced by [[#UTC|UTC]] ("Universal Time, Coordinated"), but for most practical purposes UTC and GMT are the same, so the term GMT is still commonly used.

== Hacking ==
'''Hacking''' is the process of writing code for, or contributing code to, a piece of software.

There is some controversy surrounding the meaning of this term. It began as a benign term meaning "to exercise proficiency" or "to alter or improve," but the popular media have since construed it to mean "to break into a computer system, usually with malicious intent." Many in the computer industry have recently begun trying to 'take back' the word from its popular mutation, and many have adopted the term ''cracking'' to replace the malicious interpretation. Because of the desire to reclaim the word, you will often find the term used in conjunction with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source open source] projects, intended in its benign form. For more information about the history of the term, please see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker Wikipedia's article on ''Hacker''].

== Hook ==
Hooks are specified, by the developer, in Actions and Filters. Here is a (hopefully) complete list of all [http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference existing Hooks] within WordPress.

Because Hooks are required by Actions and Filter you may hear the phrase "Action Hooks" and "Filter Hooks" used from time to time.

In technical and strict terms: a Hook is an event, i.e. event as understood by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern Observer pattern], invoked by the [[Function_Reference/do_action|<tt>do_action()</tt>]] or [[Function_Reference/apply_filters|<tt>apply_filters()</tt>]] call that afterwards triggers all the [[#Action|action]] or [[#Filter|filter]] functions, previously hooked to that event using [[Function_Reference/add_action|<tt>add_action()</tt>]] or [[Function_Reference/add_filter|<tt>add_filter()</tt>]], respectively.

WordPress Codex and source code comments sometimes confuse the terms "[http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossario#Action actions]/[http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossario#Filter filters]" and "[http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossario#Hook hooks]".

Actions, Filters and Hooks are also occasionally referred to as "action/filter hooks" or "action/filter/hook functions".

== Hosting provider ==
A '''hosting provider''' is a company or organization which provides, usually for a fee, infrastructure for making information accessible via the web. This involves the use of a [[#Web server|web server]] (including web server software such as [[#Apache|Apache]]), and may involve one or more related technologies, such as [[#FTP|FTP]], [[#PHP|PHP]], [[#MySQL|MySQL]], and operating system software such as [[#Linux|Linux]] or [[#Unix|Unix]].

A '''.htaccess''' file is a granular configuration file for the [[#Apache|Apache]] [[#Web server|web server]] software, used to set or alter the server's configuration settings for the directory in which it is present, and/or its child directories.

WordPress uses an ''.htaccess'' file in conjunction with the [[#mod_rewrite|mod_rewrite]] [[#Apache|Apache]] module to produce [[#Permalink|permalinks]].

Note that ''.htaccess'' is a ''hidden file'' in [[#Unix|Unix]]/[[#Linux|Linux]] (as dictated by the preceding period '.'), meaning it may not be visible using the default settings of some [[FTP Clients|FTP clients]].

== Indirizzo IP ==
Un '''indirizzo IP''' è un numero univoco (es. ''70.84.29.148'') assegnato ad un computer (o altro apparecchio in grado di collegarsi in rete, come una stampante di rete) per abilitarlo a comunicare con altri dispositivi usanto il ''protocollo Internet (Internet Protocol)''. &Egrave; l'identità di un computer sula rete, e ad ogni computer connesso ne è assegnato almeno uno &mdash; sebbene i metodi di assegnazione di questi indirizzi, così come la permanenza e la durata della loro assegnazione, differisce a seconda dell'uso del computer e delle circostanze del suo uso in rete.

Anche ad ogni [[#Web server|web server]] è assegnato un indirizzo IP, ma spesso i [[#Hosting provider|provider di hosting]] assegnano molteplici indirizzi IP al medesimo computer, nel caso in cui più siti web risiedano sullo stesso server fisico. Questo è molto frequente nel caso di pacchetti hosting più economici.

I [[#Dominio|nomi a dominio]] furono creati per fornire un mezzo più facile per accedere alle risorse in rete rispetto all'uso degli indirizzi IP, che sono poco maneggevoli da digitare e difficili da ricordare. Ogni dominio ha almeno un indirizzo IP corrispondente, ma solo un picolo numero di indirizzi IP hanno un nome a dominio associato d essi, in quanto solo i computer che sono server richiedono nomi a dominio. Il sistema di nomi a dominio (domain name system, [[#DNS|DNS]]) è ciò che mappa i nomi a dominio agli indirizzi IP.

== Meta ==
'''Meta''' has several meanings, but generally means '''information about'''.  In WordPress, ''meta'' usually refers to '''administrative''' type information.  As described in [[Meta Tags in WordPress]], ''meta'' is the [[#HTML|HTML]] tag used to describe and define a web page to the outside world (search engines).  In the article [[Post Meta Data Section|Post Meta Data]], ''meta'' refers to information associated with each [[Glossary|post]], such as the author's name and the date posted.  [[Codex:Guidelines#Meta Rules|Meta Rules]] define the general protocol to follow in using the Codex.  Also, many WordPress based sites offer a ''Meta'' section, usually found in the sidebar, with links to login or register at that site.  Finally, ''Meta'' is a [http://www.mediawiki.org MediaWiki] [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Namespace namespace] that refers to administrative functions within Codex.

== Microformats ==
'''Microformats''' provide a way for programs to read certain information in web pages without making the pages look any different to humans. They add semantics to the generic HTML markup in order for these programs to understand the meaning of specific parts of a web page content which is better recognized by humans. For example, a web page displaying a user's profile could use microformats to make it easy for a program to extract the user's contact information so that it can be added to an address book in a single operation. In WordPress, some [[#theme|themes]] and [[#plugin|plugins]] support some microformats.

== mod_rewrite ==
'''mod_rewrite''' is an extension module of the [[#Apache|Apache]] [[#Web server|web server]] software which allows for "rewriting" of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url URLs] on-the-fly. Rewrite ''rules'' use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression regular expressions] to parse the requested URL from the client, translate it into a different URL, and serve the content of this new URL under the original URL or pointing the client to make the new URL request.

WordPress uses ''mod_rewrite'' for its [[#Permalink|permalink]] structure, and also for [[#Multisite|multisite]] networks, which are both optional functionality.

In the WordPress user interface, a '''network''' is a collection of separate [[#Site|sites]] created in a single WordPress installation by the [[#Multisite|multisite]] feature. The sites in a WordPress network are not interconnected like the things in other kinds of networks. They are very like the separate blogs at WordPress.com.

In WordPress code the network is known as the ''site'' and the sites are known as ''blogs''.

== News reader ==
A '''news aggregator''' or '''news (feed) reader''' is a computer program which tracks syndicated information [[#Feed|feeds]], via [[#RSS|RSS]], [[#RDF|RDF]], or [[#Atom|Atom]]. Most news aggregators allow one to 'subscribe' to a feed, and automatically keep track of the articles one has read, similar to an email client tracking read emails.

Many [[#Blog|blogs]] make their content available in [[#Feed|feed]] form for the convenience of readers using news aggregators. WordPress can generate feeds in [[#RSS|RSS]] and/or [[#Atom|Atom]] formats.

== Nonce ==

'''Nonce''' is used for security purposes to protect against unexpected or duplicate requests that could cause undesired permanent or irreversible changes to the web site and particularly to its database. Specifically, a nonce is an one-time token generated by a [[#Web site|web site]] to identify future requests to that web site. When a request is submitted, the web site verifies if a previously generated nonce expected for this particular kind of request was sent along and decides whether the request can be safely processed, or an notice of failure should be returned. This could prevent unwanted repeated, expired or malicious requests from being processed.

Nonce is usually included in a hidden HTML form field or as a part of an URL and therefore sent with a request by submitting a form field or visiting a link. If a request is not verified, the web site could generate a new nonce in its response and prompt the user to intentionally  confirm the repetition of the request. In WordPress, the response message is ''"Are you sure you want to do this?"'' by default. <!-- This info is specific to WordPress and should be moved to the [[WordPress Nonces]] article when that article is more complete -->

== Page ==
A '''Page''' is often used to present "static" information about yourself or your site.  A good example of a Page is information you would place on an About Page.  A Page should not be confused with the time-oriented objects called [[#Post|posts]].   Pages are typically "timeless" in nature and live "outside" your blog.

The word "page" has long been used to describe any HTML document on the web. In WordPress, however, "Page" refers to a very specific feature first introduced in WordPress version 1.5.

== Perl ==
'''Perl''' is an acronym for '''Practical Extraction and Report Language''', but it's most commonly spelled as a proper name. It's a very popular and powerful scripting language used for web applications, although its use is being largely replaced by [[#PHP|PHP]] in the mainstream. One of its strengths lies in its speedy and effective use of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression regular expressions]. Its unofficial motto is, "There's More Than One Way To Do It," or "TMTOWTDI," owing to the extreme flexibility of the syntax.

WordPress does not use Perl, and it is therefore not required.

== Permalink ==
A '''permalink''' is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url URL] at which a resource or article will be permanently stored. Many pages driven by [[#Content Management System|Content Management Systems]] contain excerpts of content which is frequently rotated, making linking to bits of information within them a game of chance. Permalinks allow users to bookmark full articles at a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url URL] they know will never change, and will always present the same content.

Permalinks are optional in WordPress, but are highly recommended as they greatly increase the cleanliness of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url URL]. WordPress uses the [[#Apache|Apache]] module ''[[#mod_rewrite|mod_rewrite]]'' to implement its permalink system.

In general computer terms, "ping" is a common utility used in a TCP/IP environment to determine if a given [[#IP address|IP Address]] exists or is reachable.  Typically, Ping is used to diagnose a network connection problem.  Many times you will be asked, "Can you ping that address?".   That means, does the Ping utility return a success message trying to reach the "problem" [[#IP address|IP Address]]?

'''Pingback''' lets you notify the author of an article if you link to his article (article on a blog, of course). If the links you include in an article you write on a blog lead to a blog which is pingback-enabled, then the author of that blog gets a notification in the form of a pingback that you linked to his article.

== Plugin ==
A '''Plugin''' is a group of php functions that can extend the functionality present in a standard WordPress weblog. These functions may all be defined in one php file, or may be spread among more than one file. Usually, a plugin is a php file that can be uploaded to the "wp-content/plugins" directory on your webserver, where you have installed WordPress. Once you have uploaded the plugin file, you should be able to "turn it on" or Enable it from the "Plugins" page in the administration interface of your weblog.

== Post Type ==
Post type refers to the various structured data that is maintained in the WordPress posts table.  Native (or built-in) registered post types are '''post''', '''page''', '''attachment''', '''revision''', and '''nav-menu-item'''.  Custom post types are also supported in WordPress and can be defined with [[Function_Reference/register_post_type|<tt>register_post_type()</tt>]].  Custom post types allow users to easily create and manage such things as portfolios, projects, video libraries, podcasts, quotes, chats, and whatever a user or developer can imagine.

== Query String ==
A sequence of codes in a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)] that a web page uses to determine what dynamic data to display. The query string in a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier URI] comes after an initial question mark, and may contain several parameters separated by ampersands.  WordPress uses query strings to indicate criteria to search for specific posts or sets of posts in the database. The use of query strings is generally believed to impede the indexing of dynamic pages by search engines. For this reason, it is often desirable to use a method such as [[#mod_rewrite|mod_rewrite]] to reduce exposure of query strings to search engines and other site visitors.

[[#top|Torna in cima]]

==Query Variable==
A variable passed through the [[#Query_string|query string]]. For example, in the query string ''?category_name=tech&feed=atom'', there are two query variables: ''category_name'' with a value of "tech", and ''feed'' with a value of "atom".

== QuickTag ==
A '''Quicktag''' is a shortcut, or one-click button, that inserts HTML code into your posts.  The <nowiki><em></nowiki> (emphasis) and <nowiki></em></nowiki> (stop emphasis) HTML tags are example of Quicktags.  Some Quicktags, such as <nowiki><!--contactform--></nowiki>, insert HTML comment code that is used by plugins to replace text or perform certain actions.

== Relative URI ==
A relative URI (sometimes called a '''relative link''') is a partial URI that is interpreted (resolved) relative to a '''base URI'''.

On the World Wide Web, relative URIs come in two forms:

A '''relative URI with an absolute path''' is interpreted relative to the domain root:

  /images/icecream.jpg &rarr; <nowiki>http://domain.example</nowiki><strong>/images/icecream.jpg</strong>

A '''relative URI with a relative path''' is interpreted relative to the URL of the current document. E.g., on the web page ''<nowiki>http://domain.example/icecream/chocolate.html</nowiki>'',

  <strong>strawberry.html</strong> &rarr; <nowiki>http://domain.example/icecream/</nowiki><strong>strawberry.html</strong>

== RSS ==
"''Really Simple Syndication''": a format for syndicating many types of content, including blog entries, torrent files, video clips on news-like sites; specifically frequently updated content on a Web site, and is also known as a type of "feed" or "aggregator".  An RSS feed can contain a summary of content or the full text, and makes it easier for people to keep up to date with sites they like in an automated manner (much like e-mail).

The content of the feed can be read by using software called an [[#News reader|RSS or Feed reader]]. 
Feed readers display hyperlinks, and include other metadata (information about information) that helps people decide whether they want to read more, follow a link, or move on. 

The original intent of RSS is to make information come to you (via the feed reader) instead of you going out to look for it (via the Web). 

Programs called news aggregators permit users to view many feeds at once, providing 'push' content constantly. See [[:Category:Feeds]] for Codex resources about bringing RSS feeds into WordPress. See also [[#RDF|RDF]] Site Summary.

== Robots.txt ==
Web Robots are programs which traverse the Web automatically. They are also called Web Wanderers, Web Crawlers, and Spiders. Search Engines are the main Web Robots.  Some Web Robots look for a file named '''robots.txt''' on your [[#Web server|web server]] to see what and where they should look for content and files on your web server. Some Web Robots ignore this file.

== Role ==
A '''role''' gives users permission to perform a group of tasks. When a user logs in and is authenticated, the user's role determines which [[#Capabilities|capabilities]] the user has, and each capability is permission to perform one or more types of task. All users with the same role normally have the same capabilities. For example, users who have the Author role usually have permission to edit their own posts, but not permission to edit other users' posts. WordPress comes with six roles and over fifty capabilities in its role-based access system. Plugins can modify the system.

== Screen ==
In WordPress a '''screen''' is a web page used for managing part of a weblog ([[#Site|site]]) or [[#Network|network]]. The term 'screen' is used to avoid confusion with '[[#Page|page]]', which has a specific and different meaning in WordPress. For example, the web page used to manage posts is known as the [[Posts Screen]].

== Shell ==
A '''shell''' is a program which interacts directly with an operating system such as MS-DOS, [[#Unix|Unix]]/[[#Linux|Linux]], [[#Mac OS X|Mac OS X]], or others &mdash; but it is most commonly associated with [[#Unix|Unices]]. It is often referred to as a 'console' or 'command line', because it is controlled using typed commands rather than mouse or graphical interface input.

Most often, when interacting with a remote computer (as one would when configuring WordPress), an additional "faux" shell is involved called [[#SSH|SSH]].

Some popular shell programs are:
* [http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html Bash] (Bourne Again Shell)
* [http://tcsh.org/ Tcsh] (an expanded C Shell)

== Sidebar ==
A '''sidebar''' is a vertical column provided by a [[#Theme|theme]] for displaying information other than the main [[#Content|content]] of the web page. Themes usually provide at least one sidebar at the left or right of the content. Sidebars usually contain [[#Widget|widgets]] that an administrator of the site can customize.

In a theme, sidebars are generated by a [[#Template|template]] file, typically named ''sidebar.php''.

== Site ==
In the WordPress user interface, a '''site''' can simply be the website created by WordPress, or it can be a virtual website created as part of a [[Glossary#Network|network]] by the [[Glossary#Multisite|multisite]] feature. A site in a network is virtual in the sense that it does not have its own directory on the server, although it has its own URL and it might have its own domain name.

In WordPress code the site is the website created by WordPress. If multisite is in use, then the site is the network website and each virtual website is known as a ''blog''.

== Slug ==

A '''slug''' is a few words that describe a post or a page. Slugs are usually a URL friendly version of the post title (which has been automatically generated by WordPress), but a slug can be anything you like.  Slugs are meant to be used with [[#Permalink|permalinks]] as they help describe what the content at the URL is.

Example post permalink: ''http://wordpress.org/development/2006/06/wordpress-203/''

The slug for that post is "wordpress-203".

== Smileys ==

Smileys (also called Smilies or Emoticons) are stylized representations of a human face, usually displayed as yellow buttons with two dots for the eyes, and a half mouth. Smileys are often used in WordPress Plugins.  By default, WordPress automatically converts text smileys to graphic images. When you type <tt>;-)</tt> in your post you see [[Image:icon_wink.gif|Wink Icon]] when you preview or publish your post.

== Spam ==
Once upon a time, [http://www.hormel.com SPAM] was an animal by-product that came in a can and was fodder for many Monty Python sketches, but since the world-wide adoption of the internet as an integral part of daily life, Spam has become synonymous with what is wrong with the internet. Spam, in general terms, is an email or other forms of unsolicited advertising. Spam is very easy to spread throughout the internet, and works on the principle that if you send out thousands, or hundreds of thousands of unsolicited advertisements, scams, or other questionable methods of making money, that you only need a very small percentage of people to be fooled and you will make lots of money. 

Common spam these days comes from online gambling sites and those trying to sell drugs for "male enhancement." Lately, web logs, or blogs, as we call them, have been targeted by spammers to try to increase their site ratings in the search engines. Spammers use various methods to distribute their electronic junk mail, and employ bots, or computer programs to quickly and easily send email or comments to millions of addresses and [[#IP address|IPs]] all over the world. 

Spammers can be difficult to track down as they often hijack peoples' email and [[#IP address|IP]] addresses. When this happens, it may appear a friend sent you the spam, but in fact, the spammer's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot bot] grabbed your friend's email address and used it to hide the true source of the spam. WordPress [[#Developer|developers]] and community members are constantly working on more and better ways to combat these annoying '''spammers''' as they clog the internet with their garbage. You can help by offering your talents, ideas, suggestions, or just by being vigilant and installing any of the [[Combating_Comment_Spam|currently-available spam combating tools]].

[[#top|Torna in cima]]

== Tag ==
A Tag is a keyword which describes all or part of a Post. Think of it like a [[#Category|Category]], but smaller in scope. A Post may have several tags, many of which relate to it only peripherally. Like Categories, Tags are usually linked to a page which shows all Posts having the same Tag. Tags can be created on-the-fly by simply typing them into the [[Writing Posts#Post_Tags|Tag field]]. By default, tags can be assigned only to the ''Post'' and custom [[Post types|post types]].

Tags can also be displayed in [[Wikipedia:Tag Cloud|clouds]] which show large numbers of Tags in various sizes, colors, etc. This allows for a sort of total perspective on the blog, allowing people to see the sort of things your blog is about most.

Many people confuse Tags and Categories, but the difference is easy: Categories generally don't change often, while your Tags usually change with every Post and are closer to the topic of the Post.

[[#top|Torna in cima]]

== Tagline ==
A tagline is a catchy phrase that describes the character or the attributes of the blog in a brief, concise manner. Think of it as the slogan, or catchline for a weblog.

==Task Based Documentation==

Task based, or task oriented documentation is writing that takes you through a process/task step-by-step; it is succinct, lacks jargon, is easily understood, and structured entirely around performing specific tasks.

:In order to get to Z, you need to:
:#Step x
:#Step y

==Taxonomy==
A '''taxonomy''' allows for the classification of things.  In WordPress, there are two built-in taxonomies, categories and tags.  These taxonomies help further classify posts and custom post types.  Also, custom taxonomies can be defined.

== Template ==
In WordPress a '''template''' is a file that defines an area of the web pages generated by a [[#Theme|theme]]. For example, there is typically a template for the header area at the top of the web pages, a template for the [[#Content|content]], a template for the [[#Sidebar|sidebars]], and so on. The templates are like building blocks that make up the complete web page.

== Term ==
In WordPress, a '''term''' is a classification, group or subset of a [[#Taxonomy|Taxonomy]], where the latter can be a [[#Category|Category]], [[#Tag|Tag]] or Custom Taxonomy. By default, terms have a title, a slug and a description. Hierarchichal taxonomies like categories can define a parent term.

== Editor di testo ==
A '''text editor''' is a program which edits files in ''plain text'' format, as compared to ''binary'' format.  Using a non-text based word processing program (e.g. using Microsoft Word to edit [[#PHP|PHP]] scripts) can cause major problems in your code. This is because non-text based word processing programs insert extra formatting into text files, and can corrupt the files when they need to be interpreted by the interpreter. An editor like Notepad does not insert any extra formatting. 

'''Edit WordPress Files with a text only editor.'''

Some examples of file formats which need to be edited as plain text:

* [[#HTML|HTML]] documents
* [[#PHP|PHP]] scripts
* [[#Perl|Perl]] scripts

== Unicode ==
A widely supported and preferred character encoding system. 

For a computer to display letters (or any text characters), it needs to enumerate them - create an index of characters it knows how to display. These indexes are known as character sets. This is invaluable for users hosting [[Localization|WordPress in a non-English language]].

The most widely used collections of these character sets are the iso-8859 with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-1 iso-8859-1] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-15 iso-8859-15] (which contains the euro sign and some characters used in Dutch, French, Czech and Slovak) being the most common; they are also known as Latin1 and Latin9. These character sets use 8 bits (a single byte) for each character, allowing for 255 different characters (256, counting null). However, when considering that Latin-based languages aren't the only ones in the world (think Japanese or Hebrew), 255 characters aren't nearly enough.

There is a wide index of characters known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode Unicode]. Unicode has so many characters that sometimes more than 16 bits (2 bytes!) are required to represent them. Furthermore, the first 127 characters of Unicode are the same as the first 127 of the most widely used character set - iso-8859-1. For this purpose, UTF, the Unicode Translation Format, was created. UTF uses different numbers of bits for characters, and allows for the entire range of Unicode to be used. What you should probably know is:

* UTF-8 is an 8-bit-minimum type of UTF. There are also UTF-16 and UTF-32.
* If your document is in a Latin-based encoding, you probably don't need to change anything about it for it to be UTF.
* A single UTF document can be in various languages with no need to switch encodings halfway through.

== Unix Time ==
'''Unix Time''', or a '''timestamp''', is a method of tracking time by determining the approximate number of seconds from a particular event. That event is called an Epoch. Since this time format is only off by a few seconds each century, it is usually considered good enough for most applications.

Unix time is (currently) a ten digit number, and looks like this: <tt>1229362315</tt>. WordPress often uses a Unix timestamp internally to track time. The human readable times and dates you see are converted from Unix Time or from a MySQL DATETIME field.

== Widget ==
In WordPress a '''widget''' is a self-contained area of a web page that performs a specific function, or the code that generates such a self-contained area. For example, WordPress has a built-in widget that displays a list of pages in a weblog's [[#Sidebar|sidebar]], and it has another built-in widget that displays a list of recent comments in the [[#Dashboard|Dashboard]]. Plugins and themes can provide additional widgets.

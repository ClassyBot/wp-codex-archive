===New Widgets API===
WP_Widget is a class that abstracts away much of the complexity involved in writing a widget, especially multi-widgets. 
*Basically, you extend WP_Widget with your own class that provides a constructor and three methods -- widget(), form(), and update(). 
** widget() - outputs the actual content of the widget. 
** update() - processes options to be saved.  
** form() - outputs the options form.  
*A widget is registered by passing the name of the widget class to register_widget().  
*All widgets written with WP_Widget are multiple instance capable.  
*Options 
**Options for old single-instance widgets ported to WP_Widget will be upgraded to the new multi-option storage format, which is simply a multi-dimensional array keyed by instance ID. 
**Options for widgets using the old multi-instance pattern should work as is.  
**If your widget has custom option storage needs, you can provide your own get_settings() and save_settings() methods.
* The WP_Widget source can be viewed here (read the phpdoc for moreinfo on usage): http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/widgets.php
*You can see examples of how to use it here: http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/default-widgets.php
* If you author any widgets, try porting them to WP_Widget and give your feedback on what can be improved an [http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8441 Trac Ticket 8441].
* Props to the MultiWidget class, on which WP_Widget is based: http://blog.firetree.net/2008/11/30/wordpress-multi-widget/

==Appearance &rarr; Customize==

WordPress [[Version 3.4]] introduced Theme Customizer and [[Version 3.6]] directly linked it from '''Appearance > Customize'''. Also, the [[Appearance Theme Options Screen|Theme Options Screen]] has been renamed '''Customize Screen'''. It allows a Theme author to give users the chance to change certain Theme features such as color and layout in a live preview format.

Please note, the [[Appearance Theme Options Screen|Customize Screen]] is only available if the active theme supports a Customize ability.  In addition, this screen will likely be different for each Theme that enables and builds it. The Customize Screen for [[Twenty_Sixteen|WordPress Twenty Sixteen theme]], for example, provides options to change the Colors and select a background image.

=== Why use Appearance Customize? ===

The Theme Customizer allows you to preview changes to your site before publishing them. You can also navigate to different pages on your site to preview them. [[Version 4.5]] added Device Preview Buttons at the bottom of the Customizer pane. It shows how your site looks in mobile, tablet, and desktop contexts before making changes to its appearance.

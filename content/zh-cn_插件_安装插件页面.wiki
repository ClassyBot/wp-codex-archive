Plugins extend and expand the functionality of WordPress. You may automatically install plugins from the WordPress Plugin Directory or upload a plugin in .zip format via this page.

The top section of the screen has 6 tabs.  The Start Page (search), Upload, Featured, Popular, Newest, and Recently Updated.  The Search tab is active by default when you click into the Plugins - Add New menu. 

===Search Tab===

::* '''Search type''' - Pulldown the box to select one of three searches types.  '''Term''' searches plugins names and descriptions for the specified term, '''Tag''' searches for plugins tagged as such, and '''Author''' searches for plugins created by the Author, or which the Author contributed to.
::* '''Search box'''  - Enter the word, or words, that can be used to search for the Plugin you would like to find.  An example of a search Term is '''backup'''.

You can also search by popular tags by clicking on any of the tags that appear below the search box.

Completing a search causes a new tab to appear on the page called "Search Results".

This tab consists of a table with the Name, current version, star rating (from users) and description of the plugins, along with a link to attempt automatic installation.

If there are many Plugins found with your search, there will be Page Numbers at the top of the Table that will allow you to navigate to those pages.  If you don't see the Plugin you wish to install, execute a new Search via the boxes at the top of the Table.

====Install Action====
: If the Install Action is selected for a Plugin in one of the search Tables, a new window will appear showing more detail for the Plugin.  The new window may have tabs such as Description, Installation, Notes, or FAQs, containing information about that Plugin.
::* '''Cancel''' - If this isn't the Plugin you wish to install, click on the '''X''' in the top right corner of that window to cancel the installation and return to the search Table.
::* '''WordPress.org Plugin Page''' - Visit this link (opens in a new window) to view the full compatibility information and other Plugin details.

<p>The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/">WordPress Foundation</a> is a charitable organization founded by Matt Mullenweg to further the mission of the WordPress open source project: to democratize publishing through Open Source, GPL software.
</p><p>The point of the foundation is to ensure free access, in perpetuity, to the software projects we support. People and businesses may come and go, so it is important to ensure that the source code for these projects will survive beyond the current contributor base, that we may create a stable platform for web publishing for generations to come. As part of this mission, the Foundation is responsible for protecting the WordPress, WordCamp, and related trademarks. As a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, the WordPress Foundation also pursues a charter to educate the public about WordPress and related open source software.
</p><p>Contributions to the software and organization can be made in various ways, outlined in <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Contributing_to_WordPress" title="Contributing to WordPress">Contributing to WordPress</a>. All <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/donate/">financial donations</a> can be made to the Foundation, and information about it can be found on the foundation's website.

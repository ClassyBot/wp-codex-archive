<p>WP uses many flags in the code. Together we can document what we know.

<p>WP_USE_MULTIPLE_DB is used when you need to run wpmu off more than one database. It allows the administrator to spread users across several databases.
</p><p>It's not fully implemented so unless you have more than 10K users or are running on a dedicated machine its best not to worry with it.
</p><p>Other than wp.com, very few people run wpmu off of more than one db.

</p><p>This page covers the data shared with api.wordpress.org during use of an installation of WordPress software.
</p><p>WordPress is used on a huge number of websites and we want to ensure that you get the best user experience in creating your websites. We offer easy update processes for WordPress, Themes and Plugins.
</p><p>During this process we collect data from your site and store it, this information includes the following:
</p>
<ul><li>Your sites URL</li>
<li>WordPress version number</li>
<li>PHP version</li>
<li>MySQL version</li>
<li>The number of users on your blog</li>
<li>Whether you are using WordPress in 'multisite mode'</li>
<li>The number of blogs on your site</li>
<li>Your 'locale'</li>
<li>Your WordPress database version number</li>
<li>Installed and Active Themes</li>
<li>Installed and Active Plugins</li></ul>
<p>We use data such as the PHP and MySQL version to ensure we maintain WordPress's compatibility with the servers used to run it.
</p><p>We use the plugin and theme data we collect to provide an estimate of the number of sites using specific themes and plugins and also to provide a breakdown of what versions are in use across the installed sites.
</p><p>We collect this data with every check, so usually every 12 hours and we store it for 48 hours. It is only accessible by staff at WordPress.org.
</p><p>In using WordPress you accept that we collect this data from your sites, if you are not willing to share this information you will need to find a plugin to turn off update checks (which is a security risk).

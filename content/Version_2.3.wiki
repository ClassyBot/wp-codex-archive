On Monday, September 24, 2007, WordPress 2.3 [http://wordpress.org/development/2007/09/wordpress-23/ was released]. For information on the changes and improvements in this new version, see [[Changelog/2.3|Changelog for 2.3]].

For Version 2.2, the database version ('''db_version''' in '''wp_options''') is 6124.

See WordPress 2.3 [[Themes/Theme_Compatibility/2.3 |Theme Compatibility]] and [[Plugins/Plugin_Compatibility/2.3 | Plugin Compatibility]] to confirm the theme and plugins you're using are compatible. There is also [http://smithsrus.com/downloads/wordpress-upgrade-preflight-check/ Wordpress Upgrade Preflight Check] that will attempt to check your other plugins and themes for problems before you [http://codex.wordpress.org/Getting_Started_with_WordPress install WordPress] or [[Upgrading_WordPress|upgrade]]. 

Two of the top five ideas are implemented in this release: [http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/topic.php?id=30&page Plugin Update Notification] and [http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/topic.php?id=59 Tags!], and another with very high rating [http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/topic.php?id=560 Revamp the default blogroll].

== New User Features ==

The following are some of the new features of WordPress 2.3.

=== Tagging ===

In Write and Edit post there is now a tag entry field below the editor.

Using a theme that supports tag will display tags with the categories , for example:

You can change individual categories into tags using the '''Categories to Tags Converter'''. Access the converter via '''Manage > Import''' in your WordPress Administration Panels.

Tagging importers from the popular tagging plugins are included:
* Ultimate Tag Warrior
* Jerome’s Keywords
* Simple Tagging
* Bunny’s Technorati Tags

=== Improved Post and Draft Management ===

Now in '''Manage > Posts''' you can filter by search term, post type (draft, private, scheduled for future publishing, or published), author, month published, and category. You can also combine any or all of those filters and do them all at once. See [[Post Status Transitions]] for more information.

=== Pending Review ===

Drafts that are ready for review before publishing can now be easily labeled.

=== Pretty URLs ===

WWW or no-WWW? Based on your Blog Address, WordPress automatically redirects the other to your blog address.

Partial post URLs should find and redirect to the full URL.

Also, if you change the Post Slug, the old URL will redirect to the new URL.

=== Updated Default Blogroll ===

The default Blogroll now links to WordPress resources [http://wordpress.org/development Development], [http://codex.wordpress.org Documentation], [http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins Plugins], [http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas Ideas], [http://wordpress.org/support Support], [http://wordpress.org/extend/themes Themes], and [http://planet.wordpress.org Planet WordPress].

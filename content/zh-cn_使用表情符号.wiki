== 什么是表情？ ==

表情符号是在您写作时帮助表达您情感的''符号''。它们是为文章增添色彩的好帮手。[[Image:icon_smile.gif|smile emoticon]]

通常，表情符号由几个英文标点符号构成。比如：

<tt>;-)</tt> 等于 [[Image:icon_wink.gif|微笑]]<br />
<tt>:-)</tt> 等于 [[Image:icon_smile.gif|微笑]]<br />
<tt>:-(</tt> 等于 [[Image:icon_sad.gif|沮丧]]<br />
<tt>:-?</tt> 等于 [[Image:icon_confused.gif|纠结]]<br />

要了解更多关于表情符号和它们的历史，请参见[http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A1%A8%E6%83%85%E7%AC%A6%E5%8F%B7 中文维基百科“表情符号”条目]。

== WordPress 如何处理表情？ ==

WordPress 默认自动将特定文字转换成图形化图片。如，您在文章中输入 <tt>;-)</tt>，在发布后或预览时就可看到 [[Image:icon_smile.gif|smile emoticon]]。

== 关闭图形式表情 ==

若您关闭图形化表情的选项，之后您输入的任何纯文本内容将保持纯文本状态，因此只会显示纯文本。

# 前往站点后台
# 选择''设置 -> 撰写''
# 在''格式''区域，'''取消选择'''"''转换如 :-)、:-P 等文字表情符号为图像''"的选项

关闭这个选项的效果只是当您在文章中输入 <tt>;-)</tt> 时，发布后不转换成图片，而保留 <tt>;-)</tt>。这不代表您就不能在文章中以纯文本方式添加表情。[[Image:icon_wink.gif|wink emoticon]]

== 疑难解答 ==

=== 为何它不工作？ ===
Smileys may have been disabled by your WordPress admin. Another possibility is  the smiley image files have been deleted from <tt>/wp-includes/images/smilies</tt>.

=== 为何仅在某个站点不工作？ ===
''If smileys work for others at your site but not for you:''

Type a space before and after your smiley text. That prevents the smiley being accidentally included in the text around it. [[Image:icon_redface.gif|redface emoticon]]

Make sure not to use quotes or other punctuation marks before and after the smiley text. [[Image:icon_rolleyes.gif|rolleyes emoticon]]

=== 表情图片存放在何处？ ===
The smiley or emoticon image graphics are found in the <tt>/wp-includes/images/smilies</tt> directory.

Note that smileys is spelled 'eys' in this documentation and the directory name for the smiley images is '''smilies'', spelled 'ies'. [[Image:icon_eek.gif|eek emoticon]]

=== 如何自选表情图片？ ===
''Simplest way:''

# Find your smiley image files in the <tt>/wp-includes/images/smilies</tt> directory and back them up to another directory
# Note the names of each smiley file. Your files must match these names and should be in the same 'gif' image format.
# For predictable behavior, the image sizes should be similar.
# Upload your new files to the <tt>/wp-includes/images/smilies</tt> directory with an [[FTP_Clients|FTP program]].

''If you're up to hacking the code:''

If you really must change the file names of the images, edit the file that refers to these images, ''''vars.php'''' (in WordPress 2.2, they're located in ''''functions.php''''), situated in the <tt>/wp-includes/</tt> directory. Follow all precautions when "hacking code".

You can read a tutorial explaining all this in more detail, as well as how to avoid hacking WP code, at [http://aranea.zuavra.net/index.php/20/ Ars Aranea].

There are also WordPress Plugins which allow you to customize your smilies in WordPress.

=== 为什么我的表情图片是空白的？ ===
If you recently uploaded the images, it could be that the images have been uploaded in '''''ASCII''''' format by your FTP program. Re-upload the smileys ensuring that they are transferred in '''''BINARY''''' format. 

Some FTP programs have an '''auto-detect''' setting which will upload files in the correct format without user intervention. If you have such a setting, turn it on.

== 表情符号层叠样式表（CSS）样式 ==
The smiley images in WordPress are automatically given a [[Glossary#CSS|CSS]] class of '''wp-smiley''' when they are displayed in a post. You can use this class to style your smileys differently from other post images. 

For example, it's not uncommon to set up images in a post to appear on the left-hand side of the content with text flowing around the image. The CSS for that might look like this:

<pre>
.post img {
    float: left;
}
</pre> 

This would typically affect all images in a post, '''including''' your smiley images. To ''override'' this so that smileys stay inline, you could add this to your CSS:

<pre>
img.wp-smiley {
    float: none;
}
</pre>

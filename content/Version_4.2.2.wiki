== Summary ==
From the [https://wordpress.org/news/2015/05/wordpress-4-2-2/ announcement post], WordPress 4.2.2 fixes a cross-site scripting vulnerability contained in an HTML file shipped with recent Genericons packages included in the Twenty Fifteen theme as well as a number of popular plugins by removing the file. Auto-updates and manual updates will remove this file, however manual installations and those using VCS checkout (like SVN) will not remove this file. Version 4.2.2 also improves on a fix for a critical cross-site scripting vulnerability introduced in [[Version_4.2.1|4.2.1]].

The release also includes hardening for a potential cross-site scripting vulnerability when using the Visual editor.

In addition to the security fixes, WordPress 4.2.2 contains fixes for 13 bugs from [[Version_4.2.1|4.2.1]], including:

* Fixes an emoji loading error in IE9 and IE10
* Fixes a keyboard shortcut for saving from the Visual editor on Mac
* Fixes oEmbed for YouTube URLs to always expect https
* Fixes how WordPress checks for encoding when sending strings to MySQL
* Fixes a bug with allowing queries to reference tables in the <tt>dbname.tablename</tt> format
* Lowers memory usage for a regex checking for UTF-8 encoding
* Fixes an issue with trying to change the wrong index in the <tt>wp_signups</tt> table on utf8mb4 conversion
* Improves performance of loop detection in <tt>_get_term_children()</tt>
* Fixes a bug where attachment URLs were incorrectly being forced to use https in some contexts
* Fixes a bug where creating a temporary file could end up in an endless loop.

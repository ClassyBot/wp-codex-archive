<p>The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://mu.trac.wordpress.org">WPMU Trac</a> was the official bug tracking system for WordPress Multi User until early 2010. It was merged into <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/">WordPress Trac</a> during the development of WordPress 3.0 with Multi Site capability, but old MU tickets remain in WPMU Trac as references.

== Summary ==
  
From the [https://wordpress.org/news/2017/01/wordpress-4-7-2-security-release/ WordPress 4.7.2 release post]: WordPress versions 4.7.1 and earlier are affected by three security issues:

# The user interface for assigning taxonomy terms in Press This is shown to users who do not have permissions to use it. Reported by David Herrera of [https://www.alleyinteractive.com/ Alley Interactive].
# <code>WP_Query</code> is vulnerable to a SQL injection (SQLi) when passing unsafe data. WordPress core is not directly vulnerable to this issue, but weâ€™ve added hardening to prevent plugins and themes from accidentally causing a vulnerability. Reported by [https://github.com/mjangda Mo Jangda] (batmoo).
# A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the posts list table. Reported by [https://iandunn.name/ Ian Dunn] of the WordPress Security Team.

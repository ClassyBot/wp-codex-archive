<p>There is an IRC for WordPress and WPMS. Join #wordpress on irc.freenode.net with your favourite IRC client.
</p><p>The fastest way to access the channel is the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">freenode web chat</a>. One easy to use IRC client program is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/">Gaim</a>.
</p><p>It is useful because people can answer your question more quickly and interactively, so it might be fruitful to ask there first or simultaneously with a posted question on the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/WPMS_Forums" title="WPMS Forums">WPMS Forums</a>.  If you do so, posting a link to the forum question in the irc channel would be convenient for others.
</p><p>The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress">channel is logged</a>, so mind what you say if you mind that others might mind what you say.

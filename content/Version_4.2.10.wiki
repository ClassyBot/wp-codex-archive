== Summary ==
  
From the [https://wordpress.org/news/2016/09/wordpress-4-6-1-security-and-maintenance-release/ WordPress 4.6.1 release post]: WordPress versions 4.6 and earlier are affected by two security issues: a cross-site scripting vulnerability via image filename, reported by SumOfPwn researcher Cengiz Han Sahin; and a path traversal vulnerability in the upgrade package uploader, reported by Dominik Schilling from the WordPress security team.

This release also includes a fix that prevents `dbDelta()` from trying to downgrade the size of `TEXT` and `BLOB` columns. See WordPress core [https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36748 ticket #36748] for more information.

The '''Video''' feature allows you to embed video files and play them back using a simple [[Shortcode]]. This was added as of WordPress [[Version 3.6|3.6]] and is used like this:

 [video]

You can also use built in embeds and simply put the media file on its own line:

<pre>
  My cool content

  http://my.movies.com/cool/movie/coolest.mp4

  More cool content
</pre>

== Usage ==

I have an old post that has a video file in the Media Library attached to it, and I want to use the new shortcode: 

 [video]

I have the URL for an mp4, from the Media Library or external, that I want to play: 

 [video src="video-source.mp4"]

I have a source URL and fallbacks for other HTML5-supported filetypes:

 [video mp4="source.mp4" ogv="source.ogv" webm="source.webm"]

== Options ==

The following basic options are supported:

{{Parameter|src|string|The source of your video file. If not included it will auto-populate with the first video file attached to the post. You can use the following options to define specific filetypes, allowing for graceful fallbacks:<ul><li> 'mp4', 'm4v', 'webm', 'ogv', 'wmv', 'flv'</li></ul>|optional|First video file attached to the post}}

{{Parameter|poster|string|Defines image to show as placeholder before the media plays.|optional}}

{{Parameter|loop|string|Allows for the looping of media. Defaults to "off".<ul><li> "off" - ("default") does not loop the media</li><li> "on" - media will loop to beginning when finished and automatically continue playing</li></ul>|optional|"off"}}

{{Parameter|autoplay|string|Causes the media to automatically play as soon as the media file is ready. Defaults to "off".
<ul><li> "off" - ("default") does not automatically play the media</li><li>"on" - Media will play as soon as the media is ready</li></ul>|optional|"off"}}

{{Parameter|preload|string|Specifies if and how the video should be loaded when the page loads. Defaults to "metadata".<ul><li>"metadata" - ("default") only metadata should be loaded when the page loads</li><li>"none" - the video should not be loaded when the page loads</li><li>"auto" - the video should be loaded entirely when the page loads</li></ul>|optional|"metadata"}}

{{Parameter|height|integer|Defines height of the media. Value is automatically detected on file upload. |required|[Media file height]}}

{{Parameter|width|integer|Defines width of the media. Value is automatically detected on file upload. Note that the theme's content_width sets the maximum width. |required|[Media file width]}}

These options are also available in the video editor; once you've inserted a video in one of your posts, click on the video and then on the pencil icon to access and edit all the video details:

<ul>
<li>Video source file</li>
<li>Video alternate sources (mp4, ogv, webm)</li>
<li>Poster Image</li>
<li>Preload options</li>
<li>Tracks (subtitles, captions, descriptions, chapters, or metadata)</li>
</ul>

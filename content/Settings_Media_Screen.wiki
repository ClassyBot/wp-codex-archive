=== Uploading Files ===

Default settings used for during the media upload process when writing a post.

:*'''Organize my uploads into month- and year-based folders''' -  Check this box if you wish to organize your uploads into folders based on the year and the month of the upload. As of [[Version_3.5|3.5]], ''wp-content/uploads'' is the default path setting for the uploads folder. Assuming this is your path setting, if you check this box, a file uploaded in June of 2010 would be placed into the ''wp-content/uploads/2010/06'' folder.  Note: At the time of the actual upload, WordPress will automatically create the folders, such as ''wp-content/uploads/2010'' and ''wp-content/uploads/2010/06'', as long as your ''wp-content'' folder is [[Changing File Permissions|writeable]].

=== Save Changes ===
:Click the '''Save Changes''' button to ensure any changes you have made to your Settings are saved to your database.  Once you click the button, a confirmation text box will appear at the top of the page telling you your settings have been saved.

== Summary ==

From the [https://wordpress.org/news/2017/11/wordpress-4-9-1-security-and-maintenance-release/ WordPress 4.9.1 release post]: WordPress versions 4.9 and earlier are affected by four security issues which could potentially be exploited as part of a multi-vector attack. As part of the core team&#x27;s ongoing commitment to security hardening, the following fixes have been implemented in 4.9.1:

<ol>
<li>Use a properly generated hash for the <code>newbloguser</code> key instead of a determinate substring.</li>
<li>Add escaping to the language attributes used on <code>html</code> elements.</li>
<li>Ensure the attributes of enclosures are correctly escaped in RSS and Atom feeds.</li>
<li>Remove the ability to upload JavaScript files for users who do not have the <code>unfiltered_html</code> capability.</li>
</ol>

In addition to the security issues above, WordPress 4.9.1 contains 11 bug fixes.

==Links &rarr; Import Links==

If you have a bunch of links you want to import, this '''Import Links SubPanel''' is your solution.  Here you can import links from other blogs, via various websites or aggregators.

==Importing Links==

[[Image:importlinks.png|right|thumb|Importing links.]]This admininistration tool uses an OPML file from a link manager service such as [http://www.blogrolling.com/ BlogRolling] or [http://blo.gs/ Blo.gs] and others.

'''OPML''' (Outline Processor Markup Language) is an XML-based format for transferring information in an environment-independent form. For more information, see the [http://www.opml.org/ Outline Processor Markup Language Organizaion].

===Import Links SubPanel===

The '''Import Links''' subpanel is in the [[Manage_Links_SubPanel|Links Subpanel]]. Choose from either option 1 or 2 to add your blogroll.  Follow the instructions provided:

# Go to [http://www.blogrolling.com/ Blogrolling.com] and sign in. Once you’ve done that, click on Get Code, and then look for the OPML code.
# Or go to [http://blo.gs/ Blo.gs] and sign in. Once you’ve done that in the 'Welcome Back' box on the right, click on share, and then look for the OPML link (<tt>favorites.opml</tt>).
# Select that text and copy it or copy the link/shortcut into the box below.<br /><br /><span style="border:1px solid #003366; margin:20px; padding: 5px">Your OPML URL: '''Enter the OPML address'''</span><br /><br />
#  or you can upload an OPML file from your desktop aggregator:<br /><br /><span style="border:1px solid #003366; margin:20px; padding: 5px">Upload this file: '''Enter the OPML address'''</span><br /><br />
# Now select a category you want to put these links in.
# Click '''Import''' and the file will be imported.

If you use another service that isn't on there, do the similar actions with that service to create an OPML file.  If you don't know how, check with your blogroll service.

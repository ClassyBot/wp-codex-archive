== Summary ==

The primary focuses of 4.9.8 are:

* Introduce "Try Gutenberg" callout
* Privacy fixes/enhancements

=== Introduce "Try Gutenberg" callout ===

“Try Gutenberg” is an opportunity for WordPress users to try out the Gutenberg block editor before it is released in WordPress 5.0. In WordPress 4.9.8, users will see an invitation on their WordPress Admin Dashboard to try Gutenberg.

[https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/08/02/try-gutenberg-callout-in-wordpress-4-9-8/ “Try Gutenberg” Callout in WordPress 4.9.8] contains more information about the callout, including which users will, by default, be shown the callout and the hooks it provides for site administrators to modify that default behavior.

=== Privacy fixes/enhancements ===

This version includes 18 Privacy fixes focused on ensuring consistency and flexibility in the new personal data tools added in 4.9.6, including:

* The type of request being confirmed is now included in the subject line for all privacy confirmation emails.
* Improved consistency with site name being used for privacy emails in multisite.
* Increased the test coverage for several core privacy functions.
* Pagination for Privacy request admin screens can now be adjusted.

In addition to the primary focuses another notable change in 4.9.8 is that developers can now [https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/07/27/registering-metadata-in-4-9-8/ register meta keys for object subtypes]:

<blockquote>
With WordPress 4.9.8, the register_meta() function supports registration of metadata not only for an entire object type (posts, terms, comments, users), but also for a specific object subtype (such as a specific post type or taxonomy).</blockquote>

[https://wordpress.org/news/2018/08/wordpress-4-9-8-maintenance-release/ From the WordPress 4.9.8 release post]: This maintenance release fixes 46 bugs, enhancements and blessed tasks, including updating the Twenty Seventeen bundled theme.

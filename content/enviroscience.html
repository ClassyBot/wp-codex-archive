<p>Enviroscience is all about science of the environment, it is a procedure to:
(1) working enviroscience.
(2) studying enviroscience.
(3) testing enviroscience.
(4) care for enviroscience.
</p><p>Working enviroscience tend to commence approximately in 1948, due to the effect of air pollution observed; although, air pollution and ozone occurs,  noticeable in 1948. For This reason the (working Envirosciece started and clean air act was enacted in 1963. The goal of working enviroscience is to prevent making air quality worse as well as reduce the frequency and severity of the existing pollution.
</p><p>Total of Six Pollutans were Identified as Indicator of Air Quality along With Standard that Set the Maximum amount Of Pollutant which Could be released without worsening health or environmental condition.
These six pollutants become known as the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) and were divided into two segment as primary and secodary standard (pss) primary standard focus on the impact of human health &amp; secondary standard focus on a broarder enviroscience and community impacts.
But let's talk about Working EnviroScience in connection with Ozone.
Enviroscience Ozone is a natural occuring gas in the upper atmosphere; it become a pollutant when it's found at the ground level where it's created through chemical reaction, specifically, the chemical reaction occur between (Nox) and Volatile organic compound (VOCS) Mainly when sun light heat are present for Ozone to be produced.
Ozone is created from many sources.
The Working-EnviroScience sought a regulatory mean and EPA is the designed regulatory agency for compliance with the Clear Air Acts and established the NAAQS .
States are requested to develop State's Implementation Plan (SIP) to show how they will maintain compliance with the established standard.
</p><p>If a state is not in compliance (e.g non attainment) then, their plan have to show progress towards meeting the right time, EPI will determine if the state meet the standard using the information supplied within the SIP, if the statement meet the requirement, then, they are in attainment maintenance else non attainment area.
</p><p>We shall go to the (Testing-EnviroScience) in the next step

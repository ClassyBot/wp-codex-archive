== Overview ==

This page lists all holistic pages of a given Database related API. Each covers the functions involved in and use of a given set of functionality. Together they form what might be called the '''WordPress Database API''', which is the plugin/theme/add-on interface created by the entire WordPress project in respect to access data as named values stored in the database layer.

If you've read through all of these you should have a good sense of how to extend WordPress through Plugins that do access the database in an easy way.

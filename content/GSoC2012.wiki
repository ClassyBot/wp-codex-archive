== Introduction ==

Howdy Students! [http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012 Google Summer of Code 2012] is a program in which Google sponsors exceptional college students to develop open source code under the guidance of mentoring open source projects.

Unfortunately, WordPress was [http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2012/03/16/no-gsoc-2012/ not selected] as a mentoring this year. Students participating in GSoC will need to choose from one of the other participating organizations. If you are interested in contributing to WordPress anyway, we'd love to have you! See [[Contributing to WordPress]] and [http://wordpress.org/news/2009/03/contributing-to-wordpress-part-i-development/ this post] for more information.

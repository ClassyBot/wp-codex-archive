== Summary ==
From the [https://wordpress.org/news/2014/11/wordpress-4-0-1/ announcement post]:

* Three cross-site scripting issues that a contributor or author could use to compromise a site.
* A cross-site request forgery that could be used to trick a user into changing their password.
* An issue that could lead to a denial of service when passwords are checked.
* Additional protections for server-side request forgery attacks when WordPress makes HTTP requests.
* An extremely unlikely hash collision could allow a user’s account to be compromised, that also required that they haven’t logged in since 2008 (I wish I were kidding).
* WordPress now invalidates the links in a password reset email if the user remembers their password, logs in, and changes their email address.

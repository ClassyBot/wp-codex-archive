== Database Diagram ==
The diagram below provides a visual overview of the WordPress database and the relations between the tables created during the WordPress standard installation. The Table Overview below includes additional details on the tables and columns.

Please note that within the standard installation of WordPress no integrity between the tables is enforced e.g. between posts and comments. If you are creating a plugin or extension that manipulates the WordPress database, your code should do the housekeeping so that no orphan records remain in the tables e.g. by removing records in other tables with a set of SQL commands when foreign keys are deleted (Don't forget to remind users to backup before such operations).

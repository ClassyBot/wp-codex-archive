<p>From time to time, we have a Wiki_Day when a bunch of folks commit to working on the wiki. Think of it as a festival of editing! The next one is due sometime in the future, we will sure let you know about it when it happens.
</p><p>Meanwhile, you can read what happened the last time during <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Wiki_Day/2004" title="Wiki Day/2004">Wiki Day 2004</a>

<p>Proposed Wiki Day for March, 2005 at a date/time to be determined. Here is a list of what would be good to accomplish:
</p>
<ol><li>Ensure that everything that should be migrated over from the old wiki has been migrated, or is in progress.</li>
<li>Move content created by editors in their USER pages, and ensure they are named, edited for typos and such, moved into actual production pages.</li>
<li>Maintenance: Review pages for typos, delete requested pages, merge requested pages, and the like.</li>
<li>Discuss structure and formatting and related issues as well as wiki policies and such.</li>
<li>Brainstorm for content ideas, site design, usability improvements.</li></ol>
<p>This is a lot of stuff, and likely not all of it can be done in one session. A weekend would obviously work the best for this.
Add your own ideas and suggestions to the above list.
</p><p><strike><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/User:MDAWaffe" title="User:MDAWaffe">MDAWaffe</a> whines: Some of the above suggestions (all of which are good) will be difficult without a working mailing list or central forum.</strike> Actually, I suppose this article's talk page could be used as an overall discussion for the Wiki Day/Weekend. Thoughts?
</p><p>There'll be no more whining: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-docs">Docs mailing list</a>.<br />

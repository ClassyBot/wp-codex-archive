== Summary ==

From the [https://wordpress.org/news/2017/09/wordpress-4-8-2-security-and-maintenance-release/ WordPress 4.8.2 release post]: WordPress versions 4.8.1 and earlier are affected by nine security issues:
# <code>$wpdb->prepare()</code> can create unexpected and unsafe queries leading to potential SQL injection (SQLi).

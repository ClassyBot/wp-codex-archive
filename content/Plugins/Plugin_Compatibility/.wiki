As WordPress improves between versions, there will be changes to the core programming which may cause some WordPress Plugins to fail. 

If you want to check compatibility information for your favourite plugin, you can do so in the [http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ WordPress Plugin Directory], where user stats are collected showing if plugins are believed to work or not.

See also [[Themes/Theme_Compatibility|WordPress Theme Compatibilities]] for the various versions of WordPress.

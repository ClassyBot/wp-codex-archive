<p>As WordPress improves between versions, there will be changes to the core programming which may cause some WordPress Plugins to fail. 
</p><p>If you want to check compatibility information for your favourite plugin, you can do so in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">WordPress Plugin Directory</a>, where user stats are collected showing if plugins are believed to work or not.
</p><p>See also <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Themes/Theme_Compatibility" title="Themes/Theme Compatibility">WordPress Theme Compatibilities</a> for the various versions of WordPress.

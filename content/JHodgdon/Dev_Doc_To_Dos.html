<li> <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress" title="Hardening WordPress">Hardening WordPress</a> - Lorelle says: This is really, really controversial. I know it's not on your list, but security topics are and this is one of them. We need to clearly address the issue of security flaws and potential risks in WordPress, especially in WordPress Plugins, while not exposing flaws or potential "back doors" into WordPress. This is a big one and we really need to get a consensus and policy on how to write about this because it is SO important, while not opening a door we don't want open.</li></ul>

<p>These articles need to be written or are in process of being written:
</p>
<ul><li> Article on how to use custom templates and the template_redirect action in a plugin.</li>
<li> Something on internationalization when writing a Theme would be helpful...</li>
<li> <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/User:DavidHouse/Wordpress_Code_Flow" title="User:DavidHouse/Wordpress Code Flow">User:DavidHouse/Wordpress_Code_Flow</a> Per this Forum post request: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/33788">http://wordpress.org/support/topic/33788</a> - documentation of the "flow" of WordPress (<a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/User:DavidHouse" title="User:DavidHouse">DavidHouse</a> is working on it)</li>
<li> <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/User:DavidHouse/Pluggable_Functions" title="User:DavidHouse/Pluggable Functions" class="mw-redirect">User:DavidHouse/Pluggable_Functions</a> (also by <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/User:DavidHouse" title="User:DavidHouse">DavidHouse</a>)</li>
<li> Conditional Tags in Action -- lesson-style article that uses the conditional tags and includes in various methods, expanding upon the basic technical how to.  Complement to the existing <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags" title="Conditional Tags">Conditional Tags</a> article.</li>
<li> <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks#Common_WordPress_Errors" title="Codex:Tasks">Codex:Tasks#Common_WordPress_Errors</a> - From Lorelle: We really need a better listing of the most common WordPress errors with tips on how to fix them such as errors during installation, mysql errors, plugins not found errors...we need examples of what it looks like when the error occurs as people often don't have the words or language to describe the error, and then how to fix it. This would be excellent as a reference for the Support Forum.</li>
<li> <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks#Foreign_Language_Characters" title="Codex:Tasks">Codex:Tasks#Foreign_Language_Characters</a> From Lorelle: I don't know how "developer" this is, or if I should hand it off to someone on polygots, but we need some articles on handling foreign language characters in WordPress. WordPress now works well with right-to-left languages, but we need some technical articles on foreign language techniques. Recent surveys are indicating a huge demand in Japanese, Chinese, and other Asian blogs, so we need coverage in English on that so it can be translated by those support groups. Interested?</li>
<li> <b>Do's and Don'ts for WordPress Plugins</b> - From Lorelle: I'd love to see a very specific do's and don'ts for WordPress Plugin writers. I found some articles on Head Zoo (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://headzoo.com/tutorials/writing-a-wordpress-plugin">Writing a Wordpress Plugin</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://headzoo.com/tutorials/wordpress-plugin-tips-and-tricks">Plugin Tips and Tricks</a>) that may be worth approaching the author for editing and inclusion in the Codex - or using some of the offerings for a new article. We really need some WordPress Lessons to help beginners learn to write WordPress Plugins as well as technical articles. It is the hottest growing area and we need to create some very strong standards and offer articles on how to avoid security holes, another big ickie.</li>
<li> From Lorelle: I haven't been through the <b>Forum</b> looking for article ideas for a while. Have you gone through the Advanced area to look for what is hot and the most popular technical topics brought up? This is our best tool for determining what we need in the Codex. It's critically important that the support volunteers have something to point to for redundant topics.</li></ul>

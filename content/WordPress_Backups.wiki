Your WordPress database contains every post, every comment and every link you have on your blog. If your database gets erased or corrupted, you stand to lose everything you have written. There are many reasons why this could happen and not all are things you can control. With a proper backup of your WordPress database and files, you can quickly restore things back to normal.

Instructions to back up your WordPress site include:
# [[#Backing_Up_Your_WordPress_Site|WordPress Site]] and your [[#Database_Backup_Instructions|WordPress Database]]
# [[#Automatic_Backups|Automatic WordPress backup]] options

In addition, support is provided online at the [https://wordpress.org/support/ WordPress Support Forum] to help you through the process.

Site backups are essential because problems inevitably occur and you need to be in a position to take action when disaster strikes. Spending a few minutes to make an easy, convenient backup of your database will allow you to spend even more time being creative and productive with your website.

== Backup Questions ==

<div style="border:1px blue solid; margin:10px; padding: 10px; background: #E5F2FF; font-weight:bold; font-size: 130%;text-align:center">
Back up your database regularly, and always before an upgrade.

;How often should you back up? : That depends on how often you blog, how often you want to do this, and how you would feel if your database were lost along with a few posts. It is your decision.
;Can you use this method to back up other data? : Yes. Backups are good all around.
;How many backups should I keep? : The general rule of thumb is to keep at least three backups and keep them in three different places or forms, like CD/DVDs, different hard drives, a thumbdrive, web disk, your e-mail account, etc. This prevents problems if a single backup becomes corrupted or damaged.
;My database backups are huge! Can I do anything about that? : Typically, anti-spam and statistics WordPress Plugins can add large amounts of data and because they are constantly gathering information, the database can swell significantly. When backing up the database, such information is probably not important to keep. Do not mark those tables for backup when selecting them during the backup process.
;Can backups be automated? : Yes. There are several methods of automating the backup process available, and we've listed some in the [[#Automatic_Backups|Automatic WordPress backup]] section. However, it is highly recommended that you back up those auto backups with a manual backup once in a while to guarantee that the process is working. 
;Is there more information on backing up WordPress available? : Yes. See [[#Backup Resources|Backup Resources]] for more information.

== Backup Documentation ==

The following are general documents for helping you to back up and restore your WordPress data.

== Backing Up Your WordPress Site ==

There are two parts to backing up your WordPress site: '''Database''' and '''Files'''. You need to back up the entire site, and you need to back up your WordPress database.  [[#Database Backup Instructions|Below are instructions]] for backing up your WordPress database for various server programs. We will start with backing up the rest of your WordPress site.

Your WordPress site consists of the following:

# WordPress Core Installation
# WordPress Plugins
# WordPress Themes
# Images and Files
# JavaScript and PHP scripts, and other code files
# Additional Files and Static Web Pages

All of these are used in various combinations to generate your website. The database contains your posts and a lot of data generated on your site, but it does not include the above elements that all come together to create the look and information on your site. These need to be saved.

Most hosts back up the entire server, including your site, but it takes time to request a copy of your site from their backups, and a speedy recovery is critical. You need to learn how to back up your own site files and restore them. 

Here are some methods to backup your site files:
;Website Host Provided Backup Software : Most website hosts provide software to back up your site. Check with your host to find out what services and programs they provide.
;Create Sync With Your Site : [http://winscp.net/eng/index.php WinSCP] and other programs allow you to sync with your website to keep a mirror copy of the content on your server and hard drive updated. It saves time and makes sure you have the latest files in both places.
;Copy Your Files to Your Desktop : Using [[FTP Clients]] or [[UNIX Shell Skills]] you can copy the files to a folder on your computer. Once there, you can zip or compress them into a zip file to save space, allowing you to keep several versions.

Remember, keep at least three backups on file, just in case one is corrupted or lost, and store them in different places and on different mediums, like CD, DVD, different hard drives, etc.

3. Below is a picture of the default tables in the '''Structure''' view tab. You may have more tables -- this would happen if you have any statistics plugins or anti-spam plugins.

There are two methods to export, '''Quick''' and '''Custom'''; if you choose '''Custom''', follow these steps:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>Select all the tables.</li>
  <li>In the '''Output''' section check '''Save output to a file''' and select '''None''' for '''Compression'''. (If your database is very large use a compression method)</li>
  <li>Select '''SQL''' from the '''Format''' drop-down menu.</li>
	<li>Check "Add DROP TABLE": this can be useful for over-writing an existing database.</li>
	<li>Check "IF NOT EXISTS": this prevents errors during restores if the tables are already there.</li>
	<li>Click '''Go'''. The data will now be saved into your computer.</li>
</ol>

5. Keep these files safe, copied and stored in separate places on separate media.

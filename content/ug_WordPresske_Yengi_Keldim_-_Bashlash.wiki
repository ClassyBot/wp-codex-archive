Before you invest your valuable time and energy into installing WordPress, there are some documents you need to read.  WordPress is a great product; it's easy-to-use, it's quite powerful, but it isn't necessarily the right software for everyone.  Just like building a house, you have to use the right tool for the right job.  Consider [[Creating a PDF of a Codex Article|creating a PDF]] to read at your leisure.

It is important to make a plan about how you want to use WordPress on your site.  Here are some questions to ask yourself.  Make a list of the answers so you can add to your plan.

* Will you install WordPress in the root directory, subdirectory, or you just want to make a test site to make sure you want to use it?
* Have you made a list of your site [[Glossary#C|Categories]]? Understand that WordPress can only order Categories alphabetically by name or by ID (order entered through the [[Administration_Panels#Manage - Change your content|Manage]] > [[Administration_Panels#Categories|Categories]] screen), so if the display order of your Categories is important to you, start making your list of Categories. 
* Have you made a list of [[Pages]] you may want to add to your site, such as '''About''', '''Contact''', or '''Events'''?

__TOC__
'''Editor Style''' is a [[Theme Features|theme feature]] introduced with [[Version 3.0]]. This feature allows you to link a custom stylesheet file to the [[TinyMCE]] editor within the [[Writing Posts|post edit]] screen. Apart from affecting the post content appereance in the editor, this will make the CSS class definitions from the file available in the ''Styles'' list box of the TinyMCE editor and able to be assigned to the content.

== Adding Theme Support ==

There is no need to explicitly [[Function Reference/add_theme_support|add theme support]] for this feature since support is added automatically when calling:

<pre>add_editor_style();</pre>

which will, by default, link the <tt>editor-style.css</tt> file located directly under the [[Theme_Development#Anatomy_of_a_Theme|current theme directory]].

If the support isn't automatically added you can add the theme support without fear of calling it twice.

To link a different stylesheet file, give its path relative to the current theme directory as an argument to the ''<tt>[[Function Reference/add_editor_style|add_editor_style()]]</tt>'' function, like so:

<pre>add_editor_style( 'css/custom-editor-style.css' );</pre>

== More details ==

For more details about this feature and realistic examples of its usage, see the ''Description'', ''Examples'' and ''Notes'' sections on [[Function Reference/add_editor_style#Description|<tt>add_editor_style()]]</tt> which, among others, cover behavior of the function related to the use of [[Child Themes|child themes]] and changes in previous versions of WordPress.

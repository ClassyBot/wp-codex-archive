==Highlights==
Welcome to an improved Customizer workflow with design drafts, locking, scheduling, and preview links. What&#8217;s more, code syntax highlighting and error checking will make for a clean and smooth site building experience. Finally, if all that wasn&#8217;t pretty great, we&#8217;ve got a great new Gallery widget and improvements to theme browsing and switching.

===Customizer Workflow Improved===
;Draft and Schedule Site Design Customizations: Yes, you read that right. Just like you can draft and revise posts and schedule them to go live on the date and time you choose, you can now tinker with your site&#8217;s design and schedule those design changes to go live as you please.
[[image:customizer4_9-schedule.jpg|400px|Customizer Schdule function]]

;Collaborate with Design Preview Links: Need to get some feedback on proposed site design changes? WordPress 4.9 gives you a preview link you can send to your team and customers so that you can collect and integrate feedback before you schedule the changes to go live. Can we say collaboration&#43;&#43;? 

;Design Locking To Guard Your Changes: Ever encounter a scenario where two designers walk into a project and designer A overrides designer B&#8217;s beautiful changes? WordPress 4.9&#8217;s design lock feature (similar to post locking) secures your draft design so that no one can make changes to it or erase all your hard work.

;A Prompt to Protect Your Work: Were you lured away from your desk before you saved your new draft design? Fear not, when you return, WordPress 4.9 will politely ask whether or not you&#8217;d like to save your unsaved changes.
[[image:customizer4_9-autosave.jpg]]

===Coding Enhancements===
;Syntax Highlighting and Error Checking? Yes, Please!: You&#8217;ve got a display problem but can&#8217;t quite figure out exactly what went wrong in the CSS you lovingly wrote. With syntax highlighting and error checking for CSS editing and the Custom HTML widget introduced in WordPress 4.8.1, you&#8217;ll pinpoint coding errors quickly. Practically guaranteed to help you scan code more easily and suss out and fix code errors quickly.

;Sandbox for Safety: The dreaded white screen. You&#8217;ll avoid it when working on themes and plugin code because WordPress 4.9 will warn you about saving an error. You&#8217;ll sleep better at night.

;Warning, Potential Danger Ahead!: When you edit themes and plugins directly, WordPress 4.9 will politely warn you that this is a dangerous practice. It will recommend that you backup your files before saving, so they don&#8217;t get overwritten by the next update. Take the safe route: your future self will thank you. Your team and customers will thank you.

===Even More Widget Updates===
;The New Gallery Widget: An incremental improvement to the media changes hatched in WordPress 4.8, you can now add a gallery via widget. Yes!
[[image:gallery-widget.jpg]]

;Press a Button, Add Media: Want to add media to your text widget? Embed images, video, and audio directly into the widget along with your text, with our simple but useful Add Media button. Woo!
[[image:text-widget-with-media.jpg]]

;Shortcodes in Text Widget:One very longstanding request—for over 8 years is finally implemented in WordPress [[Version 4.9]]. It is no longer required to have plugins and themes do <code>add_filter( 'widget_text', 'do_shortcode' )</code>. 

===Site Building Improvements===
;More Reliable Theme Switching: When you switch themes, widgets sometimes think they can just up and move location. Improvements in WordPress 4.9 offer more persistent menu and widget placement when you decide it&#8217;s time for a new theme. Additionally, you can preview installed themes or download, install, and preview new themes right. Nothing says handy like being able to preview before you deploy.

;Better Menu Instructions = Less Confusion: Were you confused by the steps to create a new menu? Perhaps no longer! We&#8217;ve ironed out the UX for a smoother menu creation process. Newly updated copy will guide you.
[[image:customizer4_9-menu.gif]]

===Developer Happiness===
;Customizer JS API Improvements: We&#8217;ve made numerous improvements to the Customizer JS API in WordPress 4.9, eliminating many pain points and making it just as easy to work with as the PHP API. There are also new base control templates, a date/time control, and section/panel/global notifications to name a few. [https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/11/01/improvements-to-the-customize-js-api-in-4-9/ Check out the full list.]

;MediaElement.js upgraded to 4.2.6: WordPress 4.9 includes an [https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/11/01/improvements-to-the-customize-js-api-in-4-9/ upgraded version of MediaElement.js], which removes dependencies on jQuery, improves accessibility, modernizes the UI, and fixes many bugs.

;CodeMirror available for use in your themes and plugins: We&#8217;ve introduced a [https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/22/code-editing-improvements-in-wordpress-4-9/ new code editing library, CodeMirror], for use within core. Use it to improve any code writing or editing experiences within your plugins, like CSS or JavaScript include fields.

;Improvements to Roles and Capabilities: [https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/15/improvements-for-roles-and-capabilities-in-4-9/ New capabilities] have been introduced that allow granular management of plugins and translation files. In addition, the site switching process in multisite has been fine-tuned to [https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/15/improvements-for-roles-and-capabilities-in-4-9/ update the available roles and capabilities] in a more reliable and coherent way.

===The Finer Points===
;Singular capabilities for activating and deactivating individual plugins: The singular <code>activate_plugin</code> and <code>deactivate_plugin</code> capabilities are used along with the corresponding plugin name when determining whether or not a user can activate or deactivate an individual plugin.

;Sandbox PHP file edits in both plugins and themes, without auto-deactivation when an error occurs: A PHP edit that introduces a fatal error is rolled back with an opportunity then for the user to fix the error and attempt to re-save.

;Addition of dirty state for widgets on the Administration Screen: indicating when a widget has been successfully saved and showing an “Are you sure?” dialog when attempting to leave without saving changes.

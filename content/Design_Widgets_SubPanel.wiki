Themes usually have at least 1 or 2 sidebars. Sidebars are the narrow columns to the left or right of your blog posts. You can configure your sidebar by going to '''Appearance > Widgets'''. Each section in the sidebar is known as a "widget" that you can add or remove, and move up or down. 

== Configuring Your Widgets ==

To configure your sidebar widgets: 
# Click '''Appearance''' in the administrator's menu, and then click '''Widgets'''. The Widgets subtab has two sections: Available Widgets and Current Widgets. 
# In the Current Widgets section, select which sidebar you want to show/configure. '''Note:''' The default Kubrick theme has just one sidebar defined.  Other themes might have more than one sidebar defined, and if so, you'll be able to select it from the Current Widgets drop-down box.
# Click the '''Add''' button next to a widget in the Available Widgets column to add the widget to that sidebar. 
# In the Current Widgets section, drag and drop the widgets in the order you want.
# Click the '''Edit''' link on the widget to set any additional details, such as the title and number of items displayed. Each of the available widgets is described below.
# Click the '''Save Changes''' button.

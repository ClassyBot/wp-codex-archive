<ul><li> <strong>Autosave</strong> makes sure you never lose a post again.</li>

<li> Much more efficient database code, faster than previous versions. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://dammit.lt/">Domas Mituzas</a> from MySQL went over all our queries with a fine-toothed comb.</li>
<li> Links in your blogroll now support sub-categories and you can add categories on the fly.</li>

<li> WordPress Administration Panels have been refreshed to load faster and be more visually consistent.</li>

<li> Image and thumbnail API allows for richer media plugins.</li>
<li> Custom header, color picker, and image cropping framework.</li></ul>
<p>2.1 also <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=2.1">includes over 550 bug fixes</a>.
</p><p><strong>The Future</strong>
</p><p>What's really exciting for me is what's coming in the future. First of all, the 2.0 series was an unparalleled success, with over 1.8 million downloads.
</p><p>More exciting for most of our users, though, is our new development cycle. Based on everything we've learned in the past 3 years of doing WordPress, we've decided to shift to a more frequent release schedule like Ubuntu, with major releases coming several times a year. So, for the first time in WordPress' history, I have an answer to when the next version is coming out: April 23rd. 
</p><p>Even better, the development will be driven primarily by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/">the features you guys are voting for on the ideas board</a>. (As an extra, the ideas board now has a new Hot-or-Not-like interface for rating a bunch of ideas at once, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/view.php?view=not_voted">so go get your vote on and have a say in WordPress 2.2</a>.)

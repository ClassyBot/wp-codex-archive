== Summary ==
From the [https://wordpress.org/news/2015/05/wordpress-4-2-2/ announcement post], WordPress 4.1.5 fixes a cross-site scripting vulnerability contained in an HTML file shipped with recent Genericons packages included in the Twenty Fifteen theme as well as a number of popular plugins by removing the file. Auto-updates and manual updates will remove this file, however manual installations and those using VCS checkout (like SVN) will not remove this file. Version 4.1.5 also improves on a fix for a critical cross-site scripting vulnerability introduced in [[Version_4.1.4|4.1.4]].

The release also includes hardening for a potential cross-site scripting vulnerability when using the Visual editor.

WordPress 4.1.5 also contains fixes for 3 bugs from [[Version_4.1.4|4.1.4]], including:

* Lowers memory usage for a regex checking for UTF-8 encoding
* Fixes how WordPress checks for encoding when sending strings to MySQL

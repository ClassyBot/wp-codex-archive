==Tools &rarr; Erase Personal Data==

WordPress 4.9.6 included a feature to delete a user's personal data upon verified request. Deleted data is permanently removed from the database. Erasure requests cannot be reversed after they have been confirmed.

Note: Erase Personal Data tool does not remove the data from backups or archive files: When using the tool alongside automated backups or archives, we advise you to exercise caution when restoring user data from backups. When restoring an archived copy of your site, your requests for erasure should be respected.

Note: As this tool ONLY gathers data from WordPress and participating plugins, you may need to go beyond to comply with delete requests.

== Using Erase Personal Data tool ==

=== Basic Usage ===

Erase Personal Data tool uses email validation to send a user's request to an administrator.

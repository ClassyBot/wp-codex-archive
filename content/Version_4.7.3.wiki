== Summary ==

From the [https://wordpress.org/news/2017/03/wordpress-4-7-3-security-and-maintenance-release/ WordPress 4.7.3 release post]: WordPress versions 4.7.2 and earlier are affected by six security issues:

# Cross-site scripting (XSS) via media file metadata.  Reported by [https://www.securesolutions.no/ Chris Andr√® Dale], [https://twitter.com/yorickkoster Yorick Koster], and Simon P. Briggs.
# Control characters can trick redirect URL validation.  Reported by [http://www.danielchatfield.com/ Daniel Chatfield].
# Unintended files can be deleted by administrators using the plugin deletion functionality.  Reported by [http://b.360.cn/ xuliang].
# Cross-site scripting (XSS) via video URL in YouTube embeds.  Reported by [https://twitter.com/marcs0h Marc Montpas].
# Cross-site scripting (XSS) via taxonomy term names.  Reported by [https://profiles.wordpress.org/deltamgm2 Delta].
# Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) in Press This leading to excessive use of server resources.  Reported by Sipke Mellema.

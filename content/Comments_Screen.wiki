==Comments &rarr; Comments==

In the [[Comments Screen]] you can edit or delete content found in [[Glossary#Comments|comments]] to your posts, and you can mark comments as [[Glossary#Spam|spam]], send comments to the [[Trash status|trash]], and reply to comments.  A number of rules can be defined about who can write comments, and how comments are moderated.  These rules are managed via [[Administration Screens|Administration]] > [[Administration Screens#Settings|Settings]] > [[Settings Discussion Screen|Discussion]].

== Comments ==

===Table of Comments===
The Table of Comments displays all the comments, with the most recent comment displayed first.  In the instructions that follow, reference is made to using a mouse to click on fields and links, but the [[Keyboard Shortcuts]] article describes the various keyboard combinations that will allow navigation and management of comments without using the mouse.

*'''[ ]''' – This checkbox, when clicked (checked), 'selects' that particular comment to be processed by a [[#Actions|Bulk Action]].
*'''Gravatar''' - This is a picture or [[Glossary#Gravatar|gravatar]] of the comment author.  
*'''Author''' - This is the name of the comment author.  Below the comment author name is the comment author's email address that can be clicked to begin an email to that address.  Below the email address is the commenter’s web-site in the form of a URL that can be click to visit that commenter’s web-site.  Below the email address is commenter’s IP address in the form of a link.  Clicking that IP address link causes all the comments originated by that IP address to be displayed thus allowing a Bulk Action to be applied to all comments from that address.
*'''Comment''' - The first item in this column is the comment date and time presented as a link.  Click the date and time will take you to that comment on your live site. Below the date and time is the actual comment that was submitted. Hovering over any comment gives you Immediate Actions that can be performed on that comment.
*'''In Response To''' - There are three elements. The text is the name of the post that inspired the comment, and links to the post editor for that entry. The View Post link leads to that post on your live site. The small bubble with the number in it shows the number of approved comments that post has received. If the bubble is gray, you have moderated all comments for that post. If it is blue, there are pending comments. Clicking the bubble will filter the comments screen to show only comments on that post.

====Sortable Columns====
Some column headings, such as the Author, and In Response To, can be clicked to sort the Table of Comments in ascending or descending order.  Hover over the column title, for example Author, to see the up-arrow or down-arrow.  Click the heading to change the sort order.

====Page Navigation====
Under the Screen Options, the number of Comments displayed per page is determined.  If more then one page of Comments is available, two double-arrow boxes to move to the first and last page are provided.  Also two single-arrow boxes are displayed to move one page backward or forward.  Finally, a box showing the current page number can be used to enter a page to directly display. 

====Screen Options====
The [[Administration Screens#Screen_Options|Screen Options]] allow you to choose which columns are displayed, or not displayed, in the underlying Table.  Clicking on the Screen Options tab shows a list of the columns with a check-box next to each column.  Check the box for each column you want displayed in the Table, or uncheck the box to not display that column.  In addition, the number of items you want displayed in the table can be set.  Choose 1 to 999.  Click the Screen Options tab again to close the Screen Options.

====Search====
Above the Table, to the right, is a search box where you can enter a word, or series of words, and click the "Search Comments" button to search and display all the comments meeting your search words.

===Filtering Options===
At the top of this Screen are links such as All, Pending, Approved, Spam, and Trash, that when clicked, will cause just the comments of that type to be displayed in the underlying Table.  

Below that and to the right of the [[#Actions|Bulk Actions]] [[#Apply|Apply button]], is another filter option:

;Show all comment types:  This dropdown allows you to select, by type, which Posts are displayed in the [[#Table of Comments|Table of Comments]].  By default, "Show all comment types" is selected and all of the comments are displayed.  Besides all comment types, this pulldown offers the ability to filter just comments or just pings.

===Using Selection, Actions, and Apply===

====Selection====
:This Screen allows Bulk Actions to be performed on one or more comments selected in the Table.  For Bulk Actions to be performed on multiple comments at once, those comments must be first '''selected''' via one of these methods:
:*'''Select one comment at a time''' - To select a comment, the checkbox to the left of the comment entry must be checked (clicked).  It is possible to keep selecting more comments by checking their respective checkbox.
:*'''Select all comments in given Table''' - All comments in a given table can be selected by checking the checkbox in the Table's title, or footer bar.  Of course, unchecking the header or footer title bar checkbox will cause all entries in that Table to be unchecked (NOT selected). 
:*'''Reverse Selection''' - A Reverse Selection means checked items become unchecked, and unchecked items become checked. A Reverse Selection is accomplished by holding the Shift key on the keyboard and clicking the header or footer title bar checkbox.

====Actions====
:Actions describe the process to be performed on particular comments.  There are two styles of Actions that will be referred to as ''Bulk Actions'' and ''Immediate Actions''.  The following describes these Actions:

Bulk Actions are available, when appropriate, as choices in the Bulk Actions pulldown box, above the Table.  The Bulk Actions allowed are Unapprove, Approve, Mark as Spam, and Move to Trash.   
:*'''Immediate Actions''' - Immediate Actions are performed immediately, on an individual comment.  When the mouse cursor is moved over (hover) a comment, in the Comment column, under the comment itself the Immediate Actions of Unapprove, Reply, Quick Edit, Edit, Spam, and Trash appear as links.  Click one of those links to initiate the corresponding Immediate Action.

:The available Actions are described below:

If a comment is currently in an approved state then this link shows as Unapprove (in orange), but if the comment is Unapproved this link shows as Approve (in green).  Clicking the Approve or Unapprove link changes the comment to the opposite status.  Both Approve and Unapprove are available as Bulk Actions.

:*'''Spam''' - This Action, shown in red, marks the comment as spam.  Spam is available both as a Bulk Action, and an Immediate Action.  See the [[#Spam|Spam section]] for details on this Action.

== 绝对路径（Absolute Path） ==
'''绝对路径'''或'''完整路径'''，均为文件或者目录名称在计算机或文件系统所处的独特位置的描述方式。绝对路径一般以根目录的位置或驱动盘符号作为开头，用斜线（''/''）的格式来分割统一路径下的目录和子目录。

例如：''/Users/Matt/www/blog/images/icecream.jpg''
<!-- Windows: C:\Windows\... ?? -->

找到一个页面的绝对路径，可以将以下文字复制到一个新的文本文件，并保存为''path.php''（这样可以制作一个简单的PHP网页）并上传到你的服务器上，然后使用浏览器打开该文件的[[#URL|URL]]地址(例如：''http://www.example.com/path.php'')。

  <?php
  $p = getcwd();
  echo $p;
  ?>

== 分类目录（Category） ==
Each [[#Post|post]] in WordPress is filed under a '''category'''.  Thoughtful categorization allows posts to be grouped with others of similar content and aids in the navigation of a site.  Please note, the ''post category'' should not be confused with the [[Administration_Panels#Link Categories|Link Categories]] used to classify and manage [[Administration_Panels#Links_-_Putting_the_Inter_in_the_Internet|Links]].

== 用户权限（Capabilities） ==
Term related to User authentication and access control. It is an adoption of permissions in RBAC. There are about thirty capabilities in WordPress. See [[Roles and Capabilities]] for a Description of the concept and [[Roles_and_Capabilities#Capabilities|a List of Capabilites]].

== 通用网关接口（CGI） ==
'''CGI''' (Common Gateway Interface) is a specification for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side server-side] communication scripts designed to transfer information between a Web server and a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side web-client (browser)].  Typically, [[#HTML|HTML]] pages that collect data via forms use ''CGI'' programming to process the form data once the client submits it.

== 字符实体（Character Entity） ==
A '''character entity''' is a method used to display ''special characters'' normally ''reserved'' for use in [[#HTML|HTML]].  For example, the ''less than'' ('''&lt;''') and ''greater than'' ('''&gt;''') are used as part the [[#HTML|HTML]] tag structure, so both symbols are ''reserved'' for that use.  But, if you need to display those symbols on your site, you can use ''character entities''.  For example:

:use '''<code>&amp;lt;</code>'''&nbsp;&nbsp;for the less than (&lt;) symbol
:use '''<code>&amp;gt;</code>'''&nbsp;&nbsp;for the greater than (&gt;) symbol

* Related articles: [[Fun Character Entities]]

== 字符集（Character Set） ==
A '''character set''' is a collection of symbols (letters, numbers, punctuation, and special characters), when used together, represent meaningful words in a language.  Computers use an encoding scheme so members of a character set are stored with a numeric value (e.g. 0=A, 1=B, 2=C, 3=D).  In addition, a [[#Collation|collation]] determines the order (i.e alphabetic) to use when sorting the character set.

By default, WordPress uses the Unicode UTF-8 ('''utf8''') character set for the [[Database Description|WordPress MySQL database tables]] created during the [[Installing WordPress|installation process]].  Beginning with [[Version 2.2]], the database character set (and collation) is defined in the ''wp-config.php'' file.  Also note, the character set used for syndication feeds is set in the [[Administration_Panels|Administration]] > [[Administration_Panels#Reading|Settings]] > [[Settings_Reading_SubPanel|Reading]] panel.

* Related articles: [[CSS]], [[Blog Design and Layout]]

== Collation ==
'''Collation''' refers to the order used to sort the letters, numbers, and symbols of a given [[#Character set|character set]].  For example, because WordPress, by default, uses the UTF-8 ('''utf8''') character set, and when the [[Database Description|WordPress MySQL database tables]] are created during the [[Installing WordPress|installation process]], MySQL assigns '''utf8_general_ci''' collation to those table.  Beginning with [[Version 2.2]], the collation (and character set) used by WordPress is defined in the ''wp-config.php'' file.

== Comments ==
'''Comments''' are a feature of [[#Blog|blogs]] which allow readers to respond to [[#Post|posts]]. Typically readers simply provide their own thoughts regarding the [[#Content|content]] of the post, but users may also provide [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink links] to other resources, generate discussion, or simply compliment the author for a well-written post.

You can control and regulate comments by filters for language and content. Comments can be queued for approval before they are visible on the web site. This is useful in dealing with [[Comment Spam|comment spam]].

== Content ==
'''Content''' consists of text, images, or other information shared in [[#Post|posts]]. This is separate from the structural design of a web site, which provides a framework into which the content is inserted, and the presentation of a site, which involves graphic design. A [[#Content Management System|Content Management System]] changes and updates content, rather than the structural or graphic design of a web site.

== 内容管理系统（Content Management System） ==

== Database ==
A '''database''' in computing terms is software used to manage information in an organized fashion. [[#WordPress|WordPress]] uses the [[#MySQL|MySQL]] relational database management system for storing and retrieving the content of your [[#Blog|blog]], such as [[#Posts|posts]], [[#Comments|comments]], and so on.

* Related articles: [[Database Description]], [[Backing Up Your Database]]

== Default theme ==
Every installation of WordPress has a [[Glossary#Default theme|default theme]].  The default theme is sometimes called the '''fallback theme''', because if the active theme is for some reason lost or deleted, WordPress will fallback to using the default theme.

Up to [[Version 2.9.2]] the default theme was the WordPress Default theme (sometimes call Kubrick) and was housed in the ''wp-content/themes/default'' folder.  Starting with [[Version 3.0]], the [[Glossary#Twenty Ten theme|Twenty Ten theme]] became the default (and fallback) theme.

'''DOM''' (Document Object Model) is a standard, platform-independent interface that allows programmers to dynamically access HTML and XML to control the content and structure of documents.  DOM connects programming scripts to web pages.

* External links: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model DOM at Wikipedia], [http://www.w3.org/DOM/ DOM at W3C.org]

== Draft ==
The '''draft''' [[#Post status|post status]] is for WordPress [[#Post|posts]] which are saved, but as yet unpublished. A draft post can only be edited through the [[Administration Panels|Administration Panel]], [[Write Post SubPanel]] by [[Authors and Users SubPanel#Table of Authors|users]] of equal or greater [[User Levels|User Level]] than the [[Authors and Users SubPanel#Table of Registered Users|post's author]].

[[#top|Back to the Top]]

== Excerpt ==
An '''excerpt''' is a condensed description of your blog [[#Post|post]] and refers to the summary entered in the Excerpt field of the [[Administration_Panels|Administration]] > [[Administration_Panels#Add_New_Post|Posts]] > [[Posts_Add_New_SubPanel|Add New SubPanel]].  The ''excerpt'' is used to describe your post in RSS feeds and is typically used in displaying search results. The ''excerpt'' is sometimes used in displaying the '''Archives''' and [[#Category|Category]] views of your posts.  Use the [[Template Tags|Template Tag]] [[Template Tags/the excerpt|the_excerpt()]] to display the contents of this field.  Note that if you do not enter information into the Excerpt field when writing a post, and you use [[Template Tags/the excerpt|the_excerpt()]] in your theme template files, WordPress will automatically display the first 55 words of the [[#Post|post]]'s content.

An ''excerpt'' should not be confused with the '''teaser''', which refers to words before the %%%<!--more-->%%% in a [[#Post|post's]] content. When typing a long post you can insert the %%%<!--more-->%%% [[Posts_Add_New_SubPanel#Visual_Versus_HTML_Editor|Quicktag]] after a few sentences to act as a cut-off point.  When the post is displayed, the '''teaser''', followed by a hyperlink (such as '''Read the rest of this entry...'''), is displayed.  Your visitor can then click on that link to see the full version of your [[#Post|post]]. The [[Template Tags|Template Tag]], [[Template Tags/the content|the_content()]] should be used to display the teaser.

== Feed ==
<!-- DO NOT TRANSLATE THE WORD "FEED"! -->
<!-- 请不要翻译这个词！-->
A '''feed''' is a function of special software that allows "Feedreaders" to access a site automatically looking for new content and then posting the information about new content and updates to another site. This provides a way for users to keep up with the latest and hottest information posted on different blogging sites.  Some Feeds include RSS (alternately defined as "Rich Site Summary" or "Really Simple Syndication"), Atom or RDF files.  Dave Shea, author of the web design weblog [http://mezzoblue.com Mezzoblue] has written [http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/05/19/what_is_rssx/ a comprehensive summary] of feeds.  Feeds generally are based on [[#XML|XML]] technology.

== FTP ==
'''FTP''', or '''File Transfer Protocol''', is rather predictably, a client-server protocol for transferring files. It is one way to download files, and the most common way to upload files to a server.

An FTP ''client'' is a program which can download files from, or upload files to, an FTP ''server''.

You may need to use an FTP client to upload your WordPress files to your [[#Web server|web server]], particularly if you use a [[#Hosting provider|hosting provider]].

[[#top|Back to the Top]]

== Gallery ==
As defined by Andy Skelton, '''Gallery''', introduced with [[Version 2.5|WordPress 2.5]], is specifically an exposition of images attached to a post.  In that same vein, an upload is "attached to a post" when you upload it while editing a post.

In the uploader there is a "Gallery" tab that shows all the uploads attached to the post you are editing. When you have more than one attachment in a post, you should see at the bottom of the Gallery tab a button marked "Insert gallery into post". That button inserts a shortcode "[gallery]" into the post. WordPress replaces that shortcode with an exposition of all images attached to that post. Non-image file types are excluded from the gallery.

Note: If you don't see the "Insert galley into post" button, it may be because you have not attached two images to the post.

The pretty URLs for attachments are made only after you have published the post and should be composed as the post [[#permalink|permalink]] plus the attachment [[#slug|slug]].

== Hacking ==
'''Hacking''' is the process of writing code for, or contributing code to, a piece of software.

There is some controversy surrounding the meaning of this term. It began as a benign term meaning "to exercise proficiency" or "to alter or improve," but the popular media have since construed it to mean "to break into a computer system, usually with malicious intent." Many in the computer industry have recently begun trying to 'take back' the word from its popular mutation, and many have adopted the term ''cracking'' to replace the malicious interpretation. Because of the desire to reclaim the word, you will often find the term used in conjunction with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source open source] projects, intended in its benign form. For more information about the history of the term, please see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker Wikipedia's article on ''Hacker''].

== .htaccess ==
A '''.htaccess''' file is a granular configuration file for the [[#Apache|Apache]] [[#Web server|web server]] software, used to set or alter the server's configuration settings for the directory in which it is present, and/or its child directories.

WordPress uses an <code>.htaccess</code> file in conjunction with the [[#mod_rewrite|mod_rewrite]] [[#Apache|Apache]] module to produce [[#Permalink|permalinks]].

Note that <code>.htaccess</code> is a ''hidden file'' in [[#Unix|Unix]]/[[#Linux|Linux]] (as dictated by the preceding period '.'), meaning it may not be visible using the default settings of some [[FTP Clients|FTP clients]].

== HTML ==
'''HTML''', or '''Hypertext Markup Language''', is the [http://www.w3.org W3C] standard language with which all web pages are built. It is the predecessor to [[#XHTML|XHTML]], but HTML is often still used to describe either one. It is often used in conjunction with [[#CSS|CSS]] and/or [[#JavaScript|JavaScript]].

WordPress strives to conform to the [[#XHTML|XHTML]] standard.

== IP address ==
An '''IP address''' is a unique number (e.g. '''<code>70.84.29.148</code>''') assigned to a computer (or other internet-capable information appliance, such as a network printer) to enable it to communicate with other devices using the ''Internet Protocol''. It is a computer's identity on the internet, and every computer connected to the internet is assigned at least one &mdash; although the methods of assigning these addresses, and the permanence and duration of their assignment, differ according to the use of the computer and the circumstances of its internet use.

Every [[#Web server|web server]] is assigned an IP address as well, but often times [[#Hosting provider|hosting providers]] will assign multiple IP addresses to one computer, in the event that multiple web sites reside on the same physical server. This is the case with most inexpensive 'managed' or 'group' hosting packages.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name Domain names] were created to provide an easier means of accessing internet resources than IP addresses, which are cumbersome to type and difficult to remember. Every domain name has at least one corresponding IP address, but only a small number of IP addresses have a domain name associated with them, since only computers that are web servers require domain names. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS Domain Name System (DNS)] is what maps [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name Domain names] to IP addresses.

== News reader ==
A '''news aggregator''' or '''news (feed) reader''' is a computer program which tracks syndicated information [[#Feed|feeds]], via [[#RSS|RSS]], [[#RDF|RDF]], or [[#Atom|Atom]]. Most news aggregators allow one to 'subscribe' to a feed, and automatically keep track of the articles one has read, similar to an email client tracking read emails.

Many [[#Blog|blogs]] make their content available in [[#Feed|feed]] form for the convenience of readers using news aggregators. WordPress can generate feeds in [[#RSS|RSS]] and/or [[#Atom|Atom]] formats.

== Open Source ==
'''Open source''' is simply programming code that can be read, viewed, modified, and distributed, by anyone who desires.  WordPress is distributed under an ''open source''  [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html GNU General Public License (GPL)].

* Related articles: [[GPL]], [[License]]

== Page ==
A '''Page''' is often used to present "static" information about yourself or your site.  A good example of a Page is information you would place on an About Page.  A Page should not be confused with the time-oriented objects called [[#Post|posts]].   Pages are typically "timeless" in nature and live "outside" your blog.

The word "page" has long been used to describe any HTML document on the web. In WordPress, however, "Page" refers to a very specific feature first introduced in WordPress version 1.5.

* Related articles: [[Pages]], [[Write Page SubPanel]]

== Perl ==
'''Perl''' is an acronym for '''Practical Extraction and Report Language''', but it's most commonly spelled as a proper name. It's a very popular and powerful scripting language used for web applications, although its use is being largely replaced by [[#PHP|PHP]] in the mainstream. One of its strengths lies in its speedy and effective use of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression regular expressions]. Its unofficial motto is, "There's More Than One Way To Do It," or "TMTOWTDI," owing to the extreme flexibility of the syntax.

WordPress does not use Perl, and it is therefore not required.

== Permalink ==
A '''permalink''' is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url URL] at which a resource or article will be permanently stored. Many pages driven by [[#Content Management System|Content Management Systems]] contain excerpts of content which is frequently rotated, making linking to bits of information within them a game of chance. Permalinks allow users to bookmark full articles at a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url URL] they know will never change, and will always present the same content.

Permalinks are optional in WordPress, but are highly recommended as they greatly increase the cleanliness of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url URL]. WordPress uses the [[#Apache|Apache]] module <code>[[#mod_rewrite|mod_rewrite]]</code> to implement its permalink system.

* Related articles: [[Using Permalinks]]
* External links: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url URL at Wikipedia]

== Permissions ==
'''Permissions''' are security settings restricting or allowing users to perform certain functions. In the case of files on [[#Unix|Unix]] or [[#Linux|Linux]] systems, there are three types of permissions: ''read'', ''write'', and ''execute''. In the case of [[#MySQL|MySQL]] databases, there are many more: <code>SELECT</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, etc. &mdash; although MySQL refers to them as ''privileges''.

* Related articles: [[Changing File Permissions]]

== PHP ==
'''PHP''' 是 '''PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor''' 的递归首字母缩写。它是个十分流行的服务器端脚本语言，多用于与 [[#HTML|HTML]] 的集成，和 [[#MySQL|MySQL]] 配合，可制成类似[[#Content Management System|内容管理系统]]等的网页应用。PHP 可在多种平台使用，包括 Windows、[[#Unix|Unix]]/[[#Linux|Linux]] 和 [[#Mac OS X|Mac OS X]]，它是[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source 开源]软件。

WordPress 是使用 PHP 编写的，在运行时也需要 PHP。

== phpMyAdmin ==
'''phpMyAdmin''' is a popular, powerful web-based interface for administering [[#MySQL|MySQL]] databases. It is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source open source], written in [[#PHP|PHP]], and is among the better tools available for working with [[#MySQL|MySQL]] databases.

* Related articles: [[phpMyAdmin]]
* External links: [http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/ phpMyAdmin web site]

== Ping ==

Within the WordPress interface, "ping" is sometimes used to refer to [[#Pingback|Pingbacks]] and [[#Trackback|Trackbacks]].

In general computer terms, "ping" is a common utility used in a TCP/IP environment to determine if a given [[#IP address|IP Address]] exists or is reachable.  Typically, Ping is used to diagnose a network connection problem.  Many times you will be asked, "Can you ping that address?".   That means, does the Ping utility return a success message trying to reach the "problem" [[#IP address|IP Address]]?

* External links: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping Ping at Wikipedia]

== Pingback ==
'''Pingback''' lets you notify the author of an article if you link to his article (article on a blog, of course). If the links you include in an article you write on a blog lead to a blog which is pingback-enabled, then the author of that blog gets a notification in the form of a pingback that you linked to his article.

If you're feeling ''really'' geeky you may want to check out the [http://hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback Pingback technical specification] or  [http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2009-September/027425.html Otto's "How Pingbacks Work" explanation].

== Plugin ==
A '''Plugin''' is a group of php functions that can extend the functionality present in a standard WordPress weblog. These functions may all be defined in one php file, or maybe spread among more than one file. Usually, a plugin is a php file that can be uploaded to the "wp-content/plugins" directory on your webserver, where you have installed WordPress. Once you have uploaded the plugin file, you should be able to "turn it on" or Enable it from the "Plugins" page in the administration interface of your weblog. The WordPress source code contains hooks that can be used by plugins. 

* See also: [[#Hack|hack]], [[#Hacking|hacking]]
* Related articles: [[Plugins]]

== Port ==
Within the context of the WordPress community, a '''port''' is a bit of code that has been rewritten to be compatible with WordPress.  For example, if someone wrote a plugin for MoveableType, WordPress users may want to find a port of that plugin for WordPress.  Port can also be used as a verb: to rewrite a piece of software for a different platform/language.

* External links: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting Porting at Wikipedia]

== Post Slug ==
A word or two describing an entry, for use in permalinks (replaces the %posttitle% field therein), especially useful if titles tend to be long or they change frequently.

== Post Status ==
The status of a post, as set in the [[Administration Panels|Administration Panel]], [[Write Post SubPanel]] is either: '''Published''' (viewable by everyone), '''Draft''' (incomplete post viewable by anyone with proper [[User Levels|user level]]), or '''Private''' (viewable only to WordPress users at Administrator level)

== Post Type ==
Post type refers to the various structured data that is maintained in the WordPress posts table.  Native (or built-in) registered post types are '''post''', '''page''', '''attachment''', '''revision''', and '''nav-menu-item'''.  Custom post types are also supported in WordPress and can be defined with [[Function_Reference/register_post_type|register_post_type()]].  Custom post types allow users to easily create and manage such things as portfolios, projects, video libraries, podcasts, quotes, chats, and whatever a user or developer can imagine.

[[#top|Back to the Top]]

== Query string ==
A sequence of codes in a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)] that a web page uses to determine what dynamic data to display. The query string in a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier URI] comes after an initial question mark, and may contain several parameters separated by ampersands.  WordPress uses query strings to indicate criteria to search for specific posts or sets of posts in the database. The use of query strings is generally believed to impede the indexing of dynamic pages by search engines. For this reason, it is often desirable to use a method such as [[#mod_rewrite|mod_rewrite]] to reduce exposure of query strings to search engines and other site visitors.

==Query Variable==
A Variable passed through the [[#Query_string|query string]]. For example, in the query string <code>?category_name=tech&feed=atom</code>, there are two query variables: <code>category_name</code> with a value of 'tech', and <code>feed</code> with a value of 'atom'.

== QuickTag ==
A '''Quicktag''' is a shortcut, or one-click button, that inserts HTML code into your posts.  The <nowiki><em></nowiki> (emphasis) and <nowiki></em></nowiki> (stop emphasis) HTML tags are example of Quicktags.  Some Quicktags, such as <nowiki><!--contactform--></nowiki>, insert HTML comment code that is used by plugins to replace text or perform certain actions.

[[#top|Back to the Top]]


== RDF ==
Resource Description Framework. A language used to describe the locations of resources on the web. WordPress can produce output in RDF format that describes the locations of posts. Like RSS, RDF is used for content syndication.

== Relative Path ==
A '''relative path''' is the location of a file in relation to the current working directory and does not begin with a slash (/).  This is different from an [[#Absolute Path|absolute path]] which gives an exact location. 

* See also: [[#Absolute Path|Absolute Path]] 
* External links: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing) Path_Computing at Wikipedia] 

== Relative URI ==
A relative URI (sometimes called a '''relative link''') is a partial URI that is interpreted (resolved) relative to a '''base URI'''.

On the World Wide Web, relative URIs come in two forms:

A '''relative URI with an absolute path''' is interpreted relative to the domain root:

  /images/icecream.jpg &rarr; <nowiki>http://domain.example</nowiki><strong>/images/icecream.jpg</strong>

A '''relative URI with a relative path''' is interpreted relative to the URL of the current document. E.g., on the web page <code><nowiki>http://domain.example/icecream/chocolate.html</nowiki></code>,

  <strong>strawberry.html</strong> &rarr; <nowiki>http://domain.example/icecream/</nowiki><strong>strawberry.html</strong>

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#URI_resolution Wikipedia: URI Resolution]

== Recordset ==
'''Recordset''' refers to the group of records or result returned from a database query.

* See also [[#MySQL|MySQL]], [[Function_Reference/wpdb_Class|$wpdb database class]]   

== RSS ==
"''Really Simple Syndication''": a format for syndicating many types of content, including blog entries, torrent files, video clips on news-like sites; specifically frequently updated content on a Web site, and is also known as a type of "feed" or "aggregator".  An RSS feed can contain a summary of content or the full text, and makes it easier for people to keep up to date with sites they like in an automated manner (much like e-mail).

The content of the feed can be read by using software called an [[#News reader|RSS or Feed reader]]. 
Feed readers display hyperlinks, and include other metadata (information about information) that helps you decide whether they want to read more, follow a link, or move on. 

The original intent of RSS is to make information come to you (via the feed reader) instead of you going out to look for it (via the Web). 

Programs called news aggregators permit users to view many feeds at once, providing 'push' content constantly. See [[:Category:Feeds]] for Codex resources about bringing RSS feeds into WordPress. See also [[#RDF|RDF]] Site Summary.

== Robots.txt ==
Web Robots are programs which traverse the Web automatically. They are also called Web Wanderers, Web Crawlers, and Spiders. Search Engines are the main Web Robots.  Some Web Robots look for a file named '''robots.txt''' on your web server to see what and where they should look for content and files on your web server. Some Web Robots ignore this file.

[[#top|Back to the Top]]


== Shell ==
A '''shell''' is a program which interacts directly with an operating system such as MS-DOS, [[#Unix|Unix]]/[[#Linux|Linux]], [[#Mac OS X|Mac OS X]], or others &mdash; but it is most commonly associated with [[#Unix|Unices]]. It is often referred to as a 'console' or 'command line', because it is controlled using typed commands rather than mouse or graphical interface input.

Most often, when interacting with a remote computer (as one would when configuring WordPress), an additional "faux" shell is involved called [[#SSH|SSH]].

Some popular shell programs are:
* [http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html Bash] (Bourne Again Shell)
* [http://tcsh.org/ Tcsh] (an expanded C Shell)
* [http://www.zsh.org/ Zsh]

== 边栏（Sidebar） ==

The '''sidebar''', sometimes called the menu, is a narrow vertical column often jam-packed with lots of information about a website. Found on most WordPress sites, the sidebar is usually placed on the right or left-hand side of the web page, though in some cases, a site will feature two sidebars, one on each side of the main content where your posts are found.  A sidebar is also referred to as a Theme [[Templates|Template]] file and is typically called ''sidebar.php''. 

* Related articles: [[Customizing Your Sidebar]], [[Stepping Into Templates]], [[Template Hierarchy]]

== Slug ==

A '''slug''' is a few words that describe a post or a page. Slugs are usually a URL friendly version of the post title (which has been automatically generated by WordPress), but a slug can be anything you like.  Slugs are meant to be used with [[#Permalink|permalinks]] as they help describe what the content at the URL is.

Example post permalink: <code>http://wordpress.org/development/2006/06/wordpress-203/</code> 

The slug for that post is "<code>wordpress-203</code>".

== Smileys ==

Smileys (also called Smilies or Emoticons) are stylized representations of a human face, usually displayed as yellow buttons with two dots for the eyes, and a half mouth. Smileys are often used in WordPress Plugins.  By default, WordPress automatically converts text smileys to graphic images. When you type <tt>;-)</tt> in your post you see [[Image:icon_wink.gif|Wink Icon]] when you preview or publish your post.

== Spam ==
Once upon a time, [http://www.hormel.com SPAM] was an animal by-product that came in a can and was fodder for many Monty Python sketches, but since the world-wide adoption of the internet as an integral part of daily life, Spam has become synonymous with what is wrong with the internet. Spam, in general terms, is an email or other forms of unsolicited advertising. Spam is very easy to spread throughout the internet, and works on the principle that if you send out thousands, or hundreds of thousands of unsolicited advertisements, scams, or other questionable methods of making money, that you only need a very small percentage of people to be fooled and you will make lots of money. 

Common spam these days comes from online gambling sites and those trying to sell drugs for "male enhancement." Lately, web logs, or blogs, as we call them, have been targeted by spammers to try to increase their site ratings in the search engines. Spammers use various methods to distribute their electronic junk mail, and employ bots, or computer programs to quickly and easily send email or comments to millions of addresses and [[#IP address|IPs]] all over the world. 

Spammers can be difficult to track down as they often hijack peoples' email and [[#IP address|IP]] addresses. When this happens, it may appear a friend sent you the spam, but in fact, the spammer's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot bot] grabbed your friend's email address and used it to hide the true source of the spam. WordPress [[#Developer|developers]] and community members are constantly working on more and better ways to combat these annoying '''spammers''' as they clog the internet with their garbage. You can help by offering your talents, ideas, suggestions, or just by being vigilant and installing any of the [[Combating_Comment_Spam|currently-available spam combating tools]].

== SSH（Secure Shell） ==
'''SSH'''代表Secure Shell，是一种基于TCP/IP的通讯协议，用来连接远程计算机。多种验证方法使它比[[#Telnet|Telnet]]更安全。

== SSL ==
'''SSL''' stands for Secure Sockets Layer and is the predecessor to Transport Layer Security. These are cryptographic protocols for secure communications across an unsecured network like the Internet.

* External links: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer SSL at Wikipedia]

== Subversion ==
[http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] is an [[#Open Source|open-source]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control version control] software tool used by the [[Copyright Holders|WordPress Developers]] to maintain and track the changes and updates to the various WordPress versions.

== 聚合（Syndication） ==

参见：[[#RSS|简易信息聚合]]

[[#top|回到顶部]]

== Tag ==
A tag is a keyword which describes all or part of a Post. Think of it like a [[#Category|Category]], but smaller in scope. A post may have several tags, many of which relate to it only peripherally. Like Categories, Tags are usually linked to a page which shows all posts having the same tag. Unlike Categories, Tags can be created on-the-fly, by simply typing them into the tag field.

Tags can also be displayed in "clouds" which show large numbers of Tags in various sizes, colors, etc. This allows for a sort of total perspective on the blog, allowing people to see the sort of things your blog is about most.

Many people confuse Tags and Categories, but the difference is easy: Categories generally don't change often, while your Tags usually change with every Post.

== Tagline ==
A tagline is a catchy phrase that describes the character or the attributes of the blog in a brief, concise manner. Think of it as the slogan, or catchline for a weblog.

==Task Based Documentation==

Task based, or task oriented documentation is writing that takes you through a process/task step-by-step; it is succinct, lacks jargon, is easily understood, and structured entirely around performing specific tasks.

:To order to get to Z, you need to:
:#Step x
:#Step y
:#Step z
<br />
Keep in mind that people who need to know how to perform a task usually need answers quick!

==Taxonomy==
A '''taxonomy''' allows for the classification of things.  In WordPress, there are two built-in taxonomies, categories and tags.  These taxonomies help further classify posts, pages, and custom post types.  Also, custom taxonomies can be defined.

* See also: [[#Category|Category]], [[#Tag|Tag]], [[Function_Reference/register_taxonomy|register_taxonomy]]
* External links: [[Wikipedia:Taxonomy|Taxonomy at Wikipedia]]

==Telnet==
Telnet is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite communications protocol] used to establish a connection to another computer.  ''Telnet'' runs on top of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol TCP]/[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol IP] and is typically used in conjuction with terminal emulation software to login to remote computers. Telnet is inherently insecure and has largely been replaced by [[#SSH|SSH]]

* External links: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet Telnet at Wikipedia]

== 文本编辑器 ==
A '''text editor''' is a program which edits files in ''plain text'' format, as compared to ''binary'' format.  Using a non-text based word processing program (e.g. using Microsoft Word to edit [[#PHP|PHP]] scripts) can cause major problems in your code. This is because non-text based word processing programs insert extra formatting into text files, and can corrupt the files when they need to be interpreted by the interpreter. An editor like Notepad does not insert any extra formatting. 

'''Edit WordPress Files with a text only editor.'''

Some examples of file formats which need to be edited as plain text:

* [[#HTML|HTML]] documents
* [[#PHP|PHP]] scripts
* [[#Perl|Perl]] scripts
* Rich Text Format documents
* [[#JavaScript|JavaScript]] scripts

* Microsoft Word documents
* Microsoft Excel spreadsheets
* Images, such as JPEG, PNG, or GIF

Some examples of software which can edit text, but which are '''NOT''' regarded as basic text editors and '''NOT recommended''' for use on WordPress files:

* Microsoft Word
* Microsoft Works
* Microsoft Excel
* Adobe Photoshop
* Adobe Illustrator
* Adobe Dreamweaver

== Theme ==
A theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a weblog. A theme modifies the way the weblog is displayed, without modifying the underlying software. Essentially, the WordPress theme system is a way to skin your weblog.

* Related articles: [[Theme Development]], [[Using Themes]]

== Trackback ==
Trackback helps you to notify another author that you wrote something related to what he had written on his blog, even if you don't have an explicit link to his article. This improves the chances of the other author sitting up and noticing that you gave him credit for something, or that you improved upon something he wrote, or something similar. With pingback and trackback, blogs are interconnected. Think of them as the equivalents of acknowledgements and references at the end of an academic paper, or a chapter in a textbook.

== Twenty Ten theme ==
Starting with [[Version 3.0]], the [[Glossary#Twenty Ten theme|Twenty Ten theme]] became the default (and fallback) theme. As described in [http://wordpress.org/development/2009/12/2010-a-theme-odyssey/ 2010: A Theme Odyssey], the Twenty Ten theme serves as a good example theme that includes new theme-based features, and looks nice on a public site.  Twenty Ten is a community-developed theme.

Up to [[Version 2.9.2]], the default theme was the Kubrick theme and was housed in the ''wp-content/themes/default'' folder.  The Twenty Ten theme is housed in the ''wp-content/themes/twentyten'' folder and is the only theme in the WordPress distribution.

== Unicode ==
A widely supported and preferred character encoding system. 

For a computer to display letters (or any text characters), it needs to enumerate them - create an index of characters it knows how to display. These indexes are known as character sets. This is invaluable for users hosting [[Localization|WordPress in a non-English language]].

The most widely used collections of these character sets are the iso-8859 with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-1 iso-8859-1] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-15 iso-8859-15] (which contains the euro sign and some characters used in Dutch, French, Czech and Slovak) being the most common; they are also known as Latin1 and Latin9. These character sets use 8 bits (a single byte) for each character, allowing for 255 different characters (256, counting null). However, when considering that Latin-based languages aren't the only ones in the world (think Japanese or Hebrew), 255 characters aren't nearly enough.

There is a wide index of characters known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode Unicode]. Unicode has so many characters that sometimes more than 16 bits (2 bytes!) are required to represent them. Furthermore, the first 127 characters of Unicode are the same as the first 127 of the most widely used character set - iso-8859-1. For this purpose, UTF, the Unicode Translation Format, was created. UTF uses different numbers of bits for characters, and allows for the entire range of Unicode to be used. What you should probably know is:

* UTF-8 is an 8-bit-minimum type of UTF. There are also UTF-16 and UTF-32.
* If your document is in a Latin-based encoding, you probably don't need to change anything about it for it to be UTF.
* A single UTF document can be in various languages with no need to switch encodings halfway through.

* External links: [http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html Joel Spolsky on Unicode]

== Unix ==
'''Unix''', or '''UNIX''', is a computer operating system developed at AT&T's Bell Laboratories starting back in 1969. Initially designed with the objective of creating an OS written in a high level language rather than assembly, a majority of [[#Web server|web servers]] currently run on different "flavors" of this high-performance OS, or on [[#Linux|Linux]], developed as a Unix-like operating system.

* See also: [[UNIX Shell Skills]], [[#Mac OS X|Mac OS X]]

== Unix Time ==
'''Unix Time''', or a '''timestamp''', is a method of tracking time by determining the approximate number of seconds from a particular event. That event is called an Epoch. Since this time format is only off by a few seconds each century, it is usually considered good enough for most applications.

Unix time is (currently) a ten digit number, and looks like this like <tt>1229362315</tt>. WordPress often uses a Unix timestamp internally to track time. The human readable times and dates you see are converted from Unix Time or from a MySQL DATETIME field.

== 网页服务器（Web server） ==
A '''web server''' is a computer containing software for, and connected to infrastructure for, ''hosting'', or serving, web sites written in [[#HTML|HTML]]. The most common web server software on the internet is [[#Apache|Apache]], which is frequently used in conjunction with [[#PHP|PHP]], [[#Perl|Perl]], and other scripting languages.

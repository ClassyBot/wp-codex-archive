<br />[17:01] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; let's keep today extra-short
<br />[17:01] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; I'm in ireland so I know what you GMT folks feel about the time&#160;;)
<br />[17:01] &lt;Podz_&gt; LOL - about time too
<br />[17:01] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; we have nothing on the agenda, so unless anyone has any pressing items, we can probably just call it a week
<br />[17:02] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Nonces seem committed.  Please test.
<br />[17:02] * Joins: rboren
<br />[17:03] * Joins: skeltoac
<br />[17:03] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; anything else?
<br />[17:03] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; the nonce code looks good
<br />[17:04] &lt;rboren&gt; Working well for me.
<br />[17:04] * Joins: undersigned
<br />[17:04] &lt;skeltoac&gt; I upgraded and didn't even notice, so I guess it's all good for me&#160;:)
<br />[17:04] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Cool.
<br />[17:04] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; cool&#160;:)
<br />[17:05] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; alright, anything before we conclude?
<br />[17:05] &lt;undersigned&gt;&#160;:0)
<br />[17:05] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; the world's shortest WP meetup
<br />[17:05] &lt;stevecooley&gt; jeesh, what am I going to do with the rest of my hour, haha
<br />[17:05] &lt;stevecooley&gt; get back to work, I suppose&#160;:)
<br />[17:05] &lt;undersigned&gt; can i quickly add someting about the theme viewer
<br />[17:05] &lt;rboren&gt; I was one minute late and missed most of it.
<br />[17:05] &lt;rboren&gt;&#160;:-)
<br />[17:06] &lt;rboren&gt; In conclusion, nonce = cool.
<br />[17:06] &lt;skeltoac&gt; So, who's going out for BBQ?
<br />[17:06] &lt;rboren&gt; I'm going out for treadmill.
<br />[17:06] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Dude.  Don't taunt those of us that can't go out for BBQ with your BBQ-ish notions.
<br />[17:07] &lt;undersigned&gt; i have moved the uploading system from the theme park to the theme viewer, and everything works perfectly. Ive created a batch uploading function, and by using that ive uploaded 427 different themes
<br />[17:07] &lt;stevecooley&gt; holy crap, that's awesome Undersigned
<br />[17:08] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; undersigned: nice!
<br />[17:08] &lt;undersigned&gt; they are uploaded in 4 different categories, 1, 2, 3 and 4 columns
<br />[17:08] &lt;undersigned&gt; they need to be tagged some time
<br />[17:08] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; so sweet
<br />[17:08] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; so everything is working out already on the theme front?
<br />[17:09] &lt;undersigned&gt; shadow and i are talking about a few things.. when uploading a theme, selecting if the theme is 1 2 3 or 4 columns, and selecting 5 additional keywords, from a predefined list, and selecting the dominating color
<br />[17:10] &lt;stevecooley&gt; dominating colors being additional tags?
<br />[17:10] &lt;undersigned&gt; and then comments should be enabled, where people can give a theme from 1 to 5 stars, but only if they comment on the same time. "Rate and explain you rated it 5 stars"-alike
<br />[17:10] &lt;undersigned&gt; stevecooley: yea, but making a specific drop down box for color, so every theme gets a color added as tag
<br />[17:10] &lt;stevecooley&gt; ah, ok, that sounds awesome
<br />[17:10] &lt;undersigned&gt; photomatt_lap: everything is working out, quite quickly as well.. the next step is designing it
<br />[17:11] &lt;undersigned&gt; ive stolen the wp.org design and quickly made a gallery view, on the dev-viewer
<br />[17:11] &lt;undersigned&gt; if anyone care to see all the themes&#160;;)
<br />[17:11] &lt;stevecooley&gt; undersigned, would ratings go on the slideshow screen?
<br />[17:11] &lt;stevecooley&gt; or something new maybe
<br />[17:12] &lt;undersigned&gt; stevecooley: i suppose we would want to show the rating, download link and permalink on all possible views..
<br />[17:12] &lt;undersigned&gt; stevecooley: but it should only be possible to rate themes on their respective information site..

<br />[17:13] &lt;undersigned&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://themes.wordpress.net/dev/">http://themes.wordpress.net/dev/</a> &lt;- sorry for ripping the wp.org design, just needed something..
<br />[17:13] &lt;stevecooley&gt; ok, sounds really cool... some interesting problems to solve for, but it sounds like it's going to rock
<br />[17:13] &lt;undersigned&gt; thats all the 427 links, batch uploaded, snapshots made in 3 different sizes automatically
<br />[17:13] &lt;undersigned&gt; theme informations taken from style.css
<br />[17:21] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; and on that note
<br />[17:21] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; &lt;/meetup&gt;

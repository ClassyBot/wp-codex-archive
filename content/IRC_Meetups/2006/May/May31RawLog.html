<p>[17:04] * Joins: ringmaster
<br />[17:04] &lt;skeltoac&gt; hey ringo
<br />[17:04] &lt;photomatt&gt; now the band is complete
<br />[17:04] &lt;photomatt&gt; let's kick it off
<br />[17:04] &lt;photomatt&gt; &lt;meetup&gt;
<br />[17:05] &lt;photomatt&gt; let's get started with the branch so nice we had to release it thrice
<br />[17:05] &lt;photomatt&gt; 2.0.3
<br />[17:05] &lt;photomatt&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://wordpress.org/beta/wordpress-2.0.3-beta.zip">http://wordpress.org/beta/wordpress-2.0.3-beta.zip</a>
<br />[17:05] &lt;photomatt&gt; is the official beta
<br />[17:05] &lt;mumbles&gt; damm update already&#160;?
<br />[17:06] &lt;photomatt&gt; the department of wordland security has certified this release
<br />[17:06] * skeltoac snickers
<br />[17:06] &lt;PotterSys&gt; photomatt: "WordPress.org is taking a lunch break."
<br />[17:06] &lt;skeltoac&gt; old dns records still hiding somewhere
<br />[17:06] &lt;photomatt&gt; 2.0.3 + duct tape and saran wrap and you're safe from anything
<br />[17:06] &lt;photomatt&gt; PotterSys: you have bad DNS
<br />[17:07] &lt;photomatt&gt; has anyone tried 2.0.3 out?
<br />[17:07] &lt;rboren&gt; I have.
<br />[17:08] &lt;rboren&gt; But that's a given.
<br />[17:08] &lt;rboren&gt; Anyone else?
<br />[17:08] &lt;photomatt&gt; I'm running the latest 2.1 bits on my blog
<br />[17:09] &lt;rboren&gt; Me too.  I've got 2.0.3 test blogs going though.
<br />[17:09] &lt;skeltoac&gt; I'm also a trunkmonkey.
<br />[17:09] &lt;ringmaster&gt; That's... disturbing.
<br />[17:09] &lt;skeltoac&gt; (heh)
<br />[17:09] &lt;photomatt&gt; a lot of the patches were similar for 2.1 and 2.0.3
<br />[17:10] &lt;rboren&gt; Are we comfortable with nonces?  That's in 2.0.3.
<br />[17:10] &lt;rboren&gt; They're working well for me.
<br />[17:10] &lt;photomatt&gt; I can't break anything by clicking around
<br />[17:11] &lt;mumbles&gt; ill get a test blog up soon
<br />[17:11] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Will comment approval emails be two-click in 2.0.3 like in 2.1?
<br />[17:11] &lt;rboren&gt; Two click including the click in the emails?
<br />[17:11] &lt;rboren&gt; Yes.
<br />[17:12] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Blast this improved security!
<br />[17:12] &lt;rboren&gt; Curses.
<br />[17:12] &lt;rboren&gt; We got dinged for that a lot though.
<br />[17:12] &lt;Podz&gt; PotterSys - PM with the solution
<br />[17:12] &lt;photomatt&gt; yeah I think the two-click email thing sucks
<br />[17:13] * ringmaster wants a tray app that approves WP comments.
<br />[17:13] &lt;rboren&gt; The CSRF police loved to point that one out.
<br />[17:13] &lt;photomatt&gt; let's not have that in 2.1
<br />[17:13] &lt;photomatt&gt; maybe we can note in the code that it's an intended tradeoff
<br />[17:13] &lt;photomatt&gt; much like our not collecting fingerprints or social security numbers
<br />[17:14] &lt;skeltoac&gt; woe is us.
<br />[17:14] * ringmaster feels a plugin coming on.
<br />[17:14] &lt;skeltoac&gt; What are some happy things in 2.0.3?
<br />[17:14] &lt;skeltoac&gt; More hooks?
<br />[17:15] &lt;rboren&gt; More API.
<br />[17:15] &lt;rboren&gt; I think there's an extra hook or two.
<br />[17:15] &lt;gsnedders&gt; sending an Etag doesn't mean it will never send 304
<br />[17:16] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay
<br />[17:16] &lt;photomatt&gt; well now that all the coding is done, and rboren is no longer down with an injury, a release will probably be coming pretty soon
<br />[17:17] &lt;photomatt&gt; for people who like to know about that ahead of time
<br />[17:17] &lt;rboren&gt; Everybody test.
<br />[17:18] &lt;photomatt&gt; or the blog terrists will get you
<br />[17:18] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Are we going to get a 2.1 alpha bump with this 2.0.3 beta or release?
<br />[17:18] * gsnedders screams for my mummy!
<br />[17:19] &lt;photomatt&gt; ringmaster: perfect transition point!
<br />[17:19] &lt;photomatt&gt; let's talk about 2.1, bay-bee, let's talk about you and me
<br />[17:19] &lt;photomatt&gt; or just 2.1
<br />[17:19] * skeltoac shrugs
<br />[17:19] &lt;photomatt&gt; I don't know that there is really a whole bunch holding up 2.1 at this point
<br />[17:20] &lt;photomatt&gt; faster pages page and users page would definitely be Nice to Have
<br />[17:20] &lt;ringmaster&gt; No shuttle for 2.1?  No caps remix?
<br />[17:20] * Joins: io_error
<br />[17:20] * Joins: stevecooley
<br />[17:20] &lt;rboren&gt; Plugin updater would be nice.
<br />[17:21] &lt;photomatt&gt; it generally takes a month and a half after we stop adding features for a release to come out
<br />[17:21] &lt;rboren&gt; Since we're going to break so many of them.
<br />[17:21] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Heh.
<br />[17:26] &lt;photomatt&gt; ahem!
<br />[17:26] * miklb always wondered what these meetups were really about
<br />[17:26] &lt;photomatt&gt; well first question
<br />[17:26] &lt;photomatt&gt; what's new in 2.1?
<br />[17:26] &lt;rboren&gt; Page up front.
<br />[17:26] &lt;photomatt&gt; numerous bug fixes
<br />[17:26] &lt;photomatt&gt; page up front
<br />[17:26] &lt;gsnedders&gt; miklb: sex, drugs and jazz.
<br />[17:26] &lt;photomatt&gt; spell check
<br />[17:26] &lt;photomatt&gt; performance enhancements
<br />[17:26] &lt;rboren&gt; More AJAX
<br />[17:26] &lt;photomatt&gt; page status
<br />[17:26] &lt;photomatt&gt; yes, more ajax, fewer reloads
<br />[17:27] &lt;stevecooley&gt; I gotta have more AJAX!
<br />[17:27] &lt;gsnedders&gt; photomatt: does the spell check rely on TinyMCE?
<br />[17:27] &lt;io_error&gt; Nice.
<br />[17:27] &lt;photomatt&gt; bookmarks cleanup
<br />[17:27] &lt;photomatt&gt; gsnedders: yes
<br />[17:27] &lt;photomatt&gt; the interface is cleaner and more consistent
<br />[17:27] &lt;photomatt&gt; more importers
<br />[17:27] &lt;photomatt&gt; XML import/export
<br />[17:27] &lt;rboren&gt; Blog privacy
<br />[17:28] &lt;photomatt&gt; more hooks
<br />[17:28] &lt;io_error&gt; More documentation?
<br />[17:28] &lt;skeltoac&gt; I love me some hooks.
<br />[17:28] &lt;miklb&gt; rboren: blog privacy?
<br />[17:28] &lt;gsnedders&gt; and there aren't any browsers that support AppleSpell (in all NStextfields) and TinyMCE, so that question is a non-issue.
<br />[17:29] &lt;rboren&gt; You can choose not to ping and to tell robots to go away.
<br />[17:29] &lt;gsnedders&gt; next question: does it work in browsers with JavaScript disabled, or without AJAX support?
<br />[17:29] &lt;io_error&gt; rboren: people actually wanted that?
<br />[17:29] &lt;rboren&gt; Yes, a lot.
<br />[17:29] &lt;VxJasonxV&gt; io_error, yes
<br />[17:29] &lt;VxJasonxV&gt; Journals are "private things" (pah)
<br />[17:29] &lt;VxJasonxV&gt; they should be using a hand written book, but whatever&#160;:P
<br />[17:29] &lt;rboren&gt; Very popular feature on wp.com.
<br />[17:30] &lt;io_error&gt; Never put private stuff on the Internet. It will find its way out.
<br />[17:30] &lt;photomatt&gt; I think the pinging is a fairly big deal
<br />[17:30] &lt;photomatt&gt; it gives us an install-option for people to be public with their blog or not
<br />[17:30] &lt;gsnedders&gt; is it per-post?
<br />[17:30] &lt;rboren&gt; No.
<br />[17:30] &lt;io_error&gt; gsnedders: update services
<br />[17:30] &lt;photomatt&gt; if/when we start to look at plugin stats through xml-rpc, it could be on the same trigger
<br />[17:30] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Add pseudo-cron to that list of new features.
<br />[17:30] &lt;gsnedders&gt; eg. choose a single post not to ping the servers
<br />[17:31] &lt;photomatt&gt; ringmaster: yep, forgot about that
<br />[17:31] &lt;gsnedders&gt; io_error:&#160;?
<br />[17:31] &lt;io_error&gt; gsnedders: technorati, pingomatic, etc.
<br />[17:31] &lt;gsnedders&gt; io_error: yeah...
<br />[17:31] &lt;skeltoac&gt; gsnedders: no, there are no per-post don't-do-generic-ping options
<br />[17:33] &lt;photomatt&gt; ringmaster: do you think all that is enough to entice people to upgrade
<br />[17:33] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Nope.
<br />[17:33] &lt;photomatt&gt; also, is there any reason we shouldn't be offering those features to new installs?
<br />[17:34] &lt;gsnedders&gt; back to my earlier question, any plans for a bug hunt?
<br />[17:34] &lt;photomatt&gt; ringmaster: what would?
<br />[17:34] &lt;rboren&gt; Spell check alone is enough.
<br />[17:34] &lt;ringmaster&gt; We're talking about a big point release here.  Something flashy and in-your-face would be nice on top of all of these under the hood features.
<br />[17:34] &lt;miklb&gt; rboren: I would disagree on that
<br />[17:34] &lt;photomatt&gt; don't underestimate the spell-check
<br />[17:34] * gsnedders wonders why most UIs don't have spelling built in, using a dictionary shared by all apps.
<br />[17:34] &lt;skeltoac&gt; spell-check can make or break nations.
<br />[17:35] &lt;rboren&gt; We learned from wp.com that spell check is a deal breaker.
<br />[17:35] &lt;photomatt&gt; ringmaster: what would be an example of flashy and in your face?
<br />[17:35] &lt;chocotofferts&gt; pligg features would be nice
<br />[17:35] &lt;io_error&gt; NO SPAM.
<br />[17:35] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Shuttle.
<br />[17:35] &lt;miklb&gt; from my experience in the forum, the page draft, and page sticky will be hailed
<br />[17:35] &lt;skeltoac&gt; yes
<br />[17:35] &lt;photomatt&gt; shuttle isn't terribly flashy
<br />[17:35] &lt;io_error&gt; What the hell is shuttle?
<br />[17:35] &lt;ringmaster&gt; It's enough to get people's attention.
<br />[17:36] &lt;skeltoac&gt; Shuttle is a bunch of drawings.
<br />[17:36] &lt;photomatt&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.brokenkode.com/shuttle">http://www.brokenkode.com/shuttle</a>
<br />[17:36] &lt;ringmaster&gt; It's something they can *see* versus something they'd have to be a coder to understand the value of.
<br />[17:36] &lt;rboren&gt; Getting some elements of shuttle might be nice.
<br />[17:36] &lt;io_error&gt; Oh, that.
<br />[17:36] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Spell-check is nice, but I can't get too excited over something my word process has had since the dawn of time.  It's like getting excited over a vaccuum cleaner.
<br />[17:37] &lt;skeltoac&gt; That's in 2.2.
<br />[17:37] &lt;ringmaster&gt; 2.2 - The Hoover
<br />[17:37] &lt;io_error&gt; I want a kitchen sink.
<br />[17:37] &lt;gsnedders&gt; and a dog.
<br />[17:38] &lt;skeltoac&gt; I want a PHP script that rhymes and has a good plot.
<br />[17:38] &lt;ringmaster&gt; No doubt, these are all great features that everyone will learn to love.  Slowly.  Eventually.  Something that improves the UI will get people excited to try it out.
<br />[17:38] &lt;photomatt&gt; I don't know that radical interface changes could, or should, happen every single release
<br />[17:38] &lt;miklb&gt; question, 2.1 categories for bookmarks and posts are one in the same?
<br />[17:38] &lt;photomatt&gt; miklb: yes
<br />[17:38] &lt;gsnedders&gt; photomatt: no, they shouldn't.
<br />[17:38] &lt;gsnedders&gt; photomatt: it's best to stick to something people know
<br />[17:39] &lt;io_error&gt; photomatt: no, but people are likely to miss subtle changes.
<br />[17:39] &lt;photomatt&gt; I also think it's a bit of a red herring
<br />[17:39] &lt;photomatt&gt; some points:
<br />[17:39] &lt;photomatt&gt; * wp is working for a huge number of people, and adoption has never been a problem we've had
<br />[17:39] &lt;io_error&gt; well, not a BIG problem
<br />[17:40] &lt;photomatt&gt; * interface changes should address areas where we know there are usability problems
<br />[17:40] &lt;photomatt&gt; shuttle spent months arguing about whether to have tabs on the top-level menu
<br />[17:40] &lt;io_error&gt; and it's still pretty ugly.
<br />[17:40] &lt;photomatt&gt; but spent 0 time on the upload manager
<br />[17:40] * io_error plays devil's advocate
<br />[17:40] &lt;photomatt&gt; one of these has caused hundreds of support requests
<br />[17:41] &lt;photomatt&gt; so I think if we do change the more aesthetic parts of the interface, we should give equal or more attention to the places where WP is functionally broken or really non-intuitive
<br />[17:41] &lt;photomatt&gt; examine more underlying assumptions
<br />[17:41] &lt;ringmaster&gt; And I don't have a problem with that.  Let's do that and make that the flashy feature.  And improve the look of the UI in the process.
<br />[17:41] &lt;io_error&gt; And I want JavaScript pop-down menus. I have to click too much to get to what I want.&#160;:)
<br />[17:42] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Darn right.
<br />[17:42] &lt;photomatt&gt; haha
<br />[17:42] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay, so all that would be nice
<br />[17:42] &lt;skeltoac&gt; The mindreading algorithms are almost ready so you won't ever have to touch the mouse OR the keyboard.
<br />[17:42] &lt;photomatt&gt; which brings us to two questions, who does it and when does it get done?
<br />[17:42] &lt;photomatt&gt; I think in June we should focus on clearing out the 2.1 bug queue
<br />[17:43] &lt;photomatt&gt; and get that release out
<br />[17:43] &lt;io_error&gt; If I code something, it's going to be my #1 most desired feature&#160;:)
<br />[17:43] &lt;photomatt&gt; we can't build a flashy feature house on a shaky foundation
<br />[17:43] &lt;gsnedders&gt; as I've said twice before already, are we gonna have a bug hunt again?
<br />[17:43] &lt;photomatt&gt; gsnedders: yes
<br />[17:43] &lt;io_error&gt; Sure you can; it'll just fall apart&#160;:)
<br />[17:43] &lt;io_error&gt; Or creak along like it has been.
<br />[17:44] * Joins: Libertus
<br />[17:44] &lt;gsnedders&gt; photomatt: when?
<br />[17:44] &lt;photomatt&gt; gsnedders: chill!
<br />[17:44] * gsnedders is relaxed...
<br />[17:44] * gsnedders just uses one word replies when I'm bored/busy
<br />[17:45] &lt;photomatt&gt; if you look at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_1.6">http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_1.6</a>
<br />[17:45] &lt;photomatt&gt; you'll see 2.1 includes almost everything we wanted to get in 2.0
<br />[17:45] &lt;io_error&gt; Why was 1.6 called 2.0 in the first place?
<br />[17:45] &lt;Libertus&gt; Sorry, I missed the start. What's the main feature that's coming in 2.1?
<br />[17:45] &lt;io_error&gt; Libertus: spell check
<br />[17:45] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Well, I am only addressing what I think will convince more people to upgrade.  All of the featueres 2.1 has are swell, I just don't know that joe blogger gives a damn.
<br />[17:45] &lt;Libertus&gt; w00t!
<br />[17:46] &lt;photomatt&gt; ringmaster: you also said as much, and blogged as much, about 2.0
<br />[17:46] &lt;photomatt&gt; why do you think 2.0 has been so widely adopted?
<br />[17:46] &lt;io_error&gt; ringmaster: joe blogger will give a damn when all the plugins start becoming 2.1-only
<br />[17:46] &lt;Libertus&gt; photomatt: It works
<br />[17:46] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Just like they have for 2.0.
<br />[17:47] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay, then we have nothing to worry about
<br />[17:47] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Has nothing to do with 2.0 proper, just the adoption of new hooks by plugin devs.  Which is why I recommended the upgrade way back when.
<br />[17:47] &lt;io_error&gt; We have too many hooks already.
<br />[17:47] &lt;Libertus&gt; Hooks are good. Need more hooks.
<br />[17:48] * io_error points to duplicate hooks that do the same thing in different ways
<br />[17:48] &lt;skeltoac&gt; io_error is urged to upload diffs to trac
<br />[17:48] &lt;Libertus&gt; Theme hooking is a bit patchy - theme authors could do with some official guidance to make themes plugin-friendly
<br />[17:48] &lt;gsnedders&gt; hooks allow things to be done without modding the code. good. multiple hooks doing the same thing. bad.
<br />[17:48] &lt;io_error&gt; skeltoac: heh, I don't want to make that sort of decision. People's code will break.
<br />[17:48] &lt;photomatt&gt; skeltoac: you can't respond to everyone with a code or shut up response&#160;;)
<br />[17:48] &lt;skeltoac&gt; aw!
<br />[17:49] &lt;io_error&gt; Something to put on the table for 3.0, perhaps, to eliminate and consolidate duplicate hooks and other duplicate code
<br />[17:49] &lt;Libertus&gt; Which hooks are duplicates?
<br />[17:49] &lt;skeltoac&gt; Speaking of hooks, anybody want to talk about adding context to some filters?
<br />[17:49] &lt;io_error&gt; Libertus: Compare get_settings() to get_bloginfo(), for instance.
<br />[17:49] &lt;photomatt&gt; skeltoac: you can get context by looking at _SERVER
<br />[17:49] * io_error constantly gets them mixed up
<br />[17:50] &lt;skeltoac&gt; You still don't know where on the page or for what link that option was requested.
<br />[17:50] &lt;skeltoac&gt; You only know which page you're on.
<br />[17:51] &lt;photomatt&gt; if anything we should be making our underlying filter, option, etc systems simpler, not more complex
<br />[17:51] &lt;io_error&gt; Amen!
<br />[17:51] &lt;Libertus&gt; io_error: get_bloginfo() is a wrapper for get_settings() - it doesn't have its own hooks
<br />[17:51] &lt;io_error&gt; Libertus: yes, and with completely different parameters. What's the point?
<br />[17:51] &lt;Libertus&gt; Semantics
<br />[17:52] &lt;io_error&gt; Libertus: It didn't work.
<br />[17:52] &lt;Libertus&gt; One if for themes (get_bloginfo()) the other for developers and internals (get_settings())
<br />[17:52] &lt;io_error&gt; Libertus: Which is which?
<br />[17:52] &lt;io_error&gt; Libertus: And more importantly, WHY?
<br />[17:52] &lt;io_error&gt; Libertus: One can easily serve both purposes.
<br />[17:52] &lt;Libertus&gt; bloginfo is an abstraction of settings - to limit the interface to only those things a theme should be requesting
<br />[17:53] &lt;io_error&gt; Libertus: how do you know what my theme needs to request?&#160;:)
<br />[17:53] &lt;photomatt&gt; anyway, over the next month let's focus on stabilizing 2.1
<br />[17:53] &lt;Libertus&gt; io_error: I don't
<br />[17:53] &lt;photomatt&gt; which means clearing out - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=new&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=reopened&amp;milestone=2.1">http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=new&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=reopened&amp;milestone=2.1</a>
<br />[17:53] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Well, I'm done bringing the party down.  If the PTB don't agree, at least my conscience is clear for having offered my opinion.  Is this keg on?
<br />[17:53] &lt;Libertus&gt; Your theme can call get_settings, if you know what you're doing&#160;:)
<br />[17:53] &lt;photomatt&gt; even if we decide to hold off the release for more flashy features
<br />[17:53] &lt;photomatt&gt; we need to fix bugs before coding new stuff
<br />[17:53] &lt;photomatt&gt; always
<br />[17:53] &lt;io_error&gt; Libertus: Almost every theme - including the default one - calls get_settings().
<br />[17:53] &lt;Libertus&gt; Oh well, you can lead a dev to APIs but you can't make them call
<br />[17:54] &lt;io_error&gt; yes, but fixing bugs isn't sexy and doesn't get us the hot Linux women!
<br />[17:54] &lt;Libertus&gt; Perhaps a "WordPress Janitors" team?
<br />[17:54] &lt;photomatt&gt; I've also created a 2.2 milestone
<br />[17:54] &lt;photomatt&gt; for pushing things off to the next release
<br />[17:54] &lt;io_error&gt; Libertus: I see no good reason why there should be two completely different APIs that do exactly the same thing.
<br />[17:54] &lt;photomatt&gt; if something is too broad
<br />[17:54] &lt;photomatt&gt; like supporting dates prior to 1901
<br />[17:54] &lt;miklb&gt; photomatt: so as a "joe blogger" how can one help with 2.1?
<br />[17:54] &lt;Libertus&gt; io_error: They don't do exactly the same thing.
<br />[17:55] &lt;photomatt&gt; miklb: well if you're comfortable with regular backups
<br />[17:55] &lt;photomatt&gt; run it
<br />[17:55] &lt;io_error&gt; Libertus: No, one is a subset of the other.
<br />[17:55] &lt;photomatt&gt; and verify or invalidate tickets on the above link
<br />[17:55] &lt;io_error&gt; More or less.
<br />[17:55] &lt;miklb&gt; I am on a test blog, and so far so good
<br />[17:55] &lt;photomatt&gt; there are a lot of tickets in trac that might be already fixed, or might not quite apply
<br />[17:55] &lt;miklb&gt; OK.  Mainly I want to be more familiar with features so when it's official, and beta even, I can better answer in the forums
<br />[17:56] &lt;Libertus&gt; io_error: try get_settings('rss2_url')
<br />[17:56] &lt;mumbles&gt; whats the latest ofical release?
<br />[17:56] &lt;mumbles&gt; 2.0.2&#160;?
<br />[17:56] &lt;photomatt&gt; yes, and 2.0.3 is coming out shortly
<br />[17:57] &lt;miklb&gt; so when 2.0.3 is released, it will be termed "security fix"?
<br />[17:57] &lt;mumbles&gt; ok - just wanted to know if i had missed updating my sandbox site
<br />[17:57] &lt;Libertus&gt; I've noticed some activity on 2.0.3... like WP_SECRET
<br />[17:58] &lt;Libertus&gt; Looks good to me, so unless 2.1 is imminent, I'll go forward with that
<br />[17:58] &lt;photomatt&gt; miklb: yes
<br />[17:59] &lt;Libertus&gt; Any major database schema changes planned for 2.1?
<br />[17:59] &lt;Libertus&gt; I noticed the itegration of the link and post categories...
<br />[17:59] &lt;photomatt&gt; Libertus: yes, please check out the SVN
<br />[18:00] &lt;photomatt&gt; any other topics anyone would like to propose?
<br />[18:00] &lt;miklb&gt; speaking of that, were  would one start to look at how that's going to effect template tags?
<br />[18:00] &lt;miklb&gt; er, where
<br />[18:01] &lt;Libertus&gt; photomatt: Isn't there a summary somewhere?
<br />[18:01] &lt;photomatt&gt; Libertus: sumarry of what?
<br />[18:01] &lt;photomatt&gt; *summary
<br />[18:01] &lt;Libertus&gt; The intended changes to 2.1... it's one thing to start at diffs, another thing entirely to know what the intent of the diffs is
<br />[18:02] &lt;photomatt&gt; you can look at the open and closed tickets on the 2.1 milestone on trac
<br />[18:02] &lt;Libertus&gt; I can't speak for others, but some kind of management or executive summary of what's coming up would be really useful
<br />[18:02] &lt;photomatt&gt; read the transcript from earlier
<br />[18:02] &lt;io_error&gt; Libertus: what about it?
<br />[18:02] &lt;photomatt&gt; and see rboren's blog for a summary of changes thus far
<br />[18:02] &lt;Libertus&gt; rboren.nu?
<br />[18:03] &lt;photomatt&gt; no
<br />[18:03] &lt;photomatt&gt; boren.nu
<br />[18:03] &lt;Libertus&gt; Ta
<br />[18:03] &lt;photomatt&gt; rboren: hey, rboren,nu isn't a porn site anymore
<br />[18:04] &lt;gsnedders&gt;&#160;:D
<br />[18:04] &lt;Libertus&gt; photomatt: Can you help me with a post ID, or title or something?
<br />[18:04] &lt;io_error&gt; hehehehe
<br />[18:04] &lt;photomatt&gt; Libertus: not during the meetup
<br />[18:04] &lt;Libertus&gt; Oh thanks

<p>[17:05] &lt;rboren&gt; I think Matt is on  a plane, so this looks like all of us.
<br />[17:07] &lt;rboren&gt; Anyone have anything?
<br />[17:07] &lt;PotterSys&gt; anyone knows what happened in last week meetup?
<br />[17:08] &lt;mumbles&gt; PotterSys i can provide al og
<br />[17:08] &lt;mumbles&gt; but nothing happernd
<br />[17:08] * Joins: skeltoac_lappy
<br />[17:08] &lt;rboren&gt; skeltoac_lappy: Tell us something interesting.
<br />[17:08] &lt;PotterSys&gt; mumbles: "that's typical"
<br />[17:09] &lt;skeltoac_lappy&gt; rboren: I just had the best roast beef sandwich.
<br />[17:09] &lt;mumbles&gt; damm looks like my keybord is running out of battoyes
<br />[17:10] &lt;skeltoac_lappy&gt; I'm rewriting Magpie.
<br />[17:10] &lt;rboren&gt; nonces are in trunk and 2.0.  Shuttle went public.
<br />[17:11] &lt;rboren&gt; wpmu trunk got a big update.
<br />[17:11] &lt;skeltoac_lappy&gt; Canvas is pretty neat. I'm going to lean on those guys to release it as GPL. CC by-nc-sa annoys me.
<br />[17:11] &lt;rboren&gt; CC for code?  Yuck.
<br />[17:12] &lt;gsnedders&gt; Canvas?
<br />[17:12] &lt;skeltoac_lappy&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://freshpursuits.com/canvas/">http://freshpursuits.com/canvas/</a>
<br />[17:13] &lt;skeltoac_lappy&gt; I sent them a long email of praise, criticism and complaints not long ago. We'll see what we get.
<br />[17:13] &lt;mumbles&gt; i still havent receved the downlod bit so i havent had a go with it yet
<br />[17:13] &lt;mumbles&gt; but i will do as soon as i have it
<br />[17:13] &lt;skeltoac_lappy&gt; I downloaded it this morning.
<br />[17:14] &lt;skeltoac_lappy&gt; They do some great things with Scriptaculous.
<br />[17:14] &lt;gsnedders&gt; skeltoac_lappy: and why rewrite Magpie?
<br />[17:15] &lt;skeltoac_lappy&gt; gsnedders: because it doesn't understand half of RSS 2.0 and ATOM 1.0.
<br />[17:15] &lt;skeltoac_lappy&gt; gsnedders: and because we need something we can hook into.
<br />[17:16] &lt;skeltoac_lappy&gt; It's mostly done. Object hierarchies are so easy to write.
<br />[17:17] * gsnedders hasn't really used Magpie in a long time...
<br />[17:19] &lt;stevecooley&gt; you're rewriting magpie!! awesome!
<br />[17:19] &lt;stevecooley&gt; (i'm a little slow today)
<br />[17:19] &lt;skeltoac_lappy&gt; haha
<br />[17:21] &lt;gsnedders&gt; I've been working on SimplePie over the past couple of days
<br />[17:21] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; rboren: How's the spell checking stuff?
<br />[17:21] * Joins: mikelittle
<br />[17:22] &lt;skeltoac_lappy&gt; what does rboren have to do with spellcheck?
<br />[17:22] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; He seemed to be the impromptu gavel holder of the meeting&#160;:P
<br />[17:22] &lt;skeltoac_lappy&gt; ah&#160;:)
<br />[17:23] &lt;rboren&gt; Spellchecker has been in trunk for awhile, thanks to skeltoac_lappy.
<br />[17:23] * tunicwriter turns to skeltoac_lappy, then&#160;:P
<br />[17:23] &lt;rboren&gt; What else is new?  Ah yes, the exporter.
<br />[17:24] &lt;rboren&gt; Matt wrote an exporter.
<br />[17:24] &lt;rboren&gt; And we have a couple of new importers I need to commit.
<br />[17:24] &lt;PotterSys&gt; the exporter works as a RSS 2 file with lots of vitamins, if anyone wants to know...
<br />[17:25] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; so its an XML exporter?
<br />[17:26] &lt;PotterSys&gt; i think yes
<br />[17:35] &lt;rboren&gt; If that's all we have, let's adjourn.
<br />[17:36] &lt;rboren&gt; Going once...
<br />[17:36] &lt;mumbles&gt; think thats it
<br />[17:36] &lt;rboren&gt; Alright.
<br />[17:36] &lt;stevecooley&gt; adjourned'd!
<br />[17:36] &lt;rboren&gt; &lt;/meetup&gt;

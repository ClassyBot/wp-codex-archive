22:00 &lt; rboren&gt; &lt;meetup&gt;
22:00 &lt; rboren&gt; There's one thing on the agenda.
22:00 &lt; rboren&gt; Some security issues with plugins...
22:00 &lt; rboren&gt; That aren't checking caps.
22:01 &lt; rboren&gt; Which I'm looking at. Not much we can do in WP proper except make sure the default plugins are locked down tight.
22:01 &lt; rboren&gt; And remind people to check caps in their plugins.
22:01 &lt; skeltoac&gt; How are the docs on this?
22:02 &lt; rboren&gt; Haven't looked yet.
22:02 &lt; rboren&gt; Need to audit docs.
22:03 &lt; rboren&gt; WP does not check caps for plugins.  All it does is make sure the user is logged in when accessing plugins through the admin.
22:03 &lt; rboren&gt; We fixed some bugs like this for db backup in 2.0.3...
22:04 &lt; rboren&gt; So, we need to audit the default plugins, audit docs to make it clear that plugins need to check caps, and notify authors of compomised plugins.
22:05&#160;::: bazza [n=bazza@c-24-5-66-10.hsd1.ca.comcast.net] has joined #wordpress-meetup
22:05 &lt; rboren&gt; Anything else on that?
22:06 &lt; rboren&gt; Okay then. Let's talk 2.0.4.
22:06 &lt; rboren&gt; Getting thumbs up on testers list.
22:06 &lt; rboren&gt; We wittled down the bugs against the 2.0.4 milestone pretty well.
22:06 &lt; rboren&gt; I think we should release a beta soonish.
22:06 &lt; rboren&gt; Get one more round of testing.
22:06 &lt; rboren&gt; And get it out the door.
22:07 &lt; skeltoac&gt; Sounds good.
22:08 &lt; rboren&gt; Show and tell time?  Anyone got fun stuff in the works?
22:09 &lt; skeltoac&gt; Scott Wallick (plaintxt.org) and I have been working on a theme
22:09 &lt; mdawaffe&gt; workinng on a slim backpack style plugin for wp
22:09 &lt; mdawaffe&gt; only a local copy at the moment
22:09 &lt; mdawaffe&gt; skeltoac: yeah - that sounds hot
22:09 &lt; skeltoac&gt; thanks mdawaffe
22:10 &lt; skeltoac&gt; We're making it very strong in the markup department
22:10 &lt; skeltoac&gt; and including a skin chooser for picking stylesheets
22:11 &lt; skeltoac&gt; I'd love it if this became the new default theme. It has a Kubrick skin already.
22:11 &lt; skeltoac&gt; It comes with some base stylesheets for 1-col, 2-col and 3-col layouts
22:11 &lt; skeltoac&gt; all using the same markup
22:11&#160;::: You're now known as westi
22:11 &lt; mdawaffe&gt; skeltoac: do all your fancy classes have any appreciable overhead?
22:12 &lt; mdawaffe&gt; I imagine not
22:12 &lt; skeltoac&gt; mdawaffe: Not that I've seen. They do stuff like is_single
22:12 &lt; skeltoac&gt; mostly bool checks
22:12 &lt; mdawaffe&gt; sure
22:15 &lt; skeltoac&gt; We'll have something for public testing soon.
22:15&#160;::: gsnedders [n=gsnedder@host81-156-237-58.range81-156.btcentralplus.com] has quit []
22:18 &lt; rboren&gt; I've got nothing else.  Anyone?
22:18 &lt; skeltoac&gt; not so much
22:19 &lt; rboren&gt; Let's call it.
22:19 &lt; rboren&gt; &lt;/meetup&gt;

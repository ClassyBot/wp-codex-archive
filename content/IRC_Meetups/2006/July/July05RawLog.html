<br />[17:03] &lt;rboren&gt; Whoops.  Technical difficulties.
<br />[17:03] &lt;rboren&gt; So, one item on the agenda.
<br />[17:03] &lt;rboren&gt; Which is the bug hunt.
<br />[17:03] * Joins: Winnopeg1
<br />[17:04] &lt;io_error&gt; Isn't the bug hunt ongoing?
<br />[17:04] &lt;rboren&gt; Yes.
<br />[17:04] &lt;io_error&gt; Okay then.
<br />[17:04] &lt;rboren&gt; We'll do a quick post mortem of what's gone down so far.
<br />[17:04] * Joins: twidget
<br />[17:04] &lt;rboren&gt; ~ 40 commits.
<br />[17:04] &lt;rboren&gt; And several new contributors...
<br />[17:04] &lt;io_error&gt; How many new bugs in those commits?
<br />[17:04] &lt;rboren&gt; Which is nice.
<br />[17:05] &lt;rboren&gt; I haven't broken it down yet, but many have been lingering for awhile.
<br />[17:05] &lt;io_error&gt; Well, that isn't exactly what I meant...&#160;;)
<br />[17:05] * Joins: blognewb
<br />[17:05] &lt;rboren&gt; Bugs created by new code, you mean?
<br />[17:05] &lt;io_error&gt; Right.&#160;:)
<br />[17:05] * Joins: PotterSys_
<br />[17:05] &lt;rboren&gt; Yes, most bugs so far have been in the system for awhile.
<br />[17:06] &lt;rboren&gt; I think we knocked most of the nonce and redirect bugs out just before the bug hunt.
<br />[17:06] &lt;io_error&gt; It seems there is a LOT of stuff just hanging around in there.
<br />[17:06] &lt;io_error&gt; Dating back to 1.5 and maybe before that.
<br />[17:06] &lt;rboren&gt; Yes, filosofo cleaned out lots of old ones, but we still have many just hanging.
<br />[17:06] * Parts: twidget ("Leaving"�)
<br />[17:07] &lt;rboren&gt; I'd like to test those and close them if they can't be reproduced.
<br />[17:07] * Joins: psc-eric-
<br />[17:07] &lt;io_error&gt; I'm thinking we should have a fairly regularly scheduled bug hunt.
<br />[17:07] &lt;rboren&gt; Yes, if we can keep interest in it.
<br />[17:07] * Quits: PotterSys ("<br />[Potter System - Using SysReset]"�)
<br />[17:08] &lt;rboren&gt; I think we should have at least one more for 2.1.
<br />[17:08] &lt;io_error&gt; Absolutely.
<br />[17:08] * Joins: Podz
<br />[17:08] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; rboren: Please do, I was a bit too busy for this one and I wanted to contribute...
<br />[17:08] &lt;io_error&gt; ^^^ And that's why I think we should have regularly scheduled ones.
<br />[17:09] &lt;rboren&gt; What would be a good schedule.  Every two weeks, every month?
<br />[17:09] * Joins: skeltoac_lappy
<br />[17:09] &lt;io_error&gt; I'm thinking twice a month or so.
<br />[17:09] &lt;mumbles&gt; mounth probably
<br />[17:09] &lt;io_error&gt; Until the number of bugs comes down.
<br />[17:09] &lt;Winnopeg1&gt; Yeah, maybe twice a month.

<br />[17:09] * PotterSys_ is now known as PotterSys
<br />[17:09] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; Twice a month++
<br />[17:10] &lt;rboren&gt; We can start a twice a month and adjust if needed.
<br />[17:10] &lt;io_error&gt; And because people have different schedules, in addition to being all over the world, I think one should be on the weekend, while the other is during the week.
<br />[17:10] &lt;io_error&gt; That way most anyone can participate at least once a month.
<br />[17:10] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; What io_error said...
<br />[17:10] &lt;rboren&gt; Sounds good.
<br />[17:11] &lt;Winnopeg1&gt; Yup.
<br />[17:11] &lt;io_error&gt; I'm not usually this full of good ideas. Take advantage of it while it lasts.&#160;:)
<br />[17:11] &lt;rboren&gt; Should we have hunt agendas like we do for meetups?
<br />[17:11] &lt;rboren&gt; Target certain areas perhaps.
<br />[17:12] &lt;Winnopeg1&gt; That would be neat.
<br />[17:12] &lt;io_error&gt; Sure, but not necessarily fixed ones. After all, what needs to be done changes.
<br />[17:12] &lt;skeltoac_lappy&gt; We seem to deal with known bugs more than find new ones during "hunts." Maybe we should call them Massacres or Crusades.&#160;:)
<br />[17:13] &lt;rboren&gt; We found some new ones, mainly validation ones.
<br />[17:13] &lt;rboren&gt; Some folks took the admin pages and ran them through the validator and turned up some issues.
<br />[17:13] &lt;skeltoac_lappy&gt; good stuff
<br />[17:14] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; rboren: If you're thinking what I think you are, having hunting agendas may be too skill specific and deter some people...
<br />[17:14] &lt;rboren&gt; Well, I think it would be along the lines of, "We changed this area a lot, let's focus on testing it."
<br />[17:15] &lt;rboren&gt; Such as with nonces or redirects.
<br />[17:15] &lt;rboren&gt; But people can test whatever they want, of course.
<br />[17:16] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; Ah alrighty.
<br />[17:17] &lt;rboren&gt; Anyone want to take the Bug Hunt codex page and update the schedule info?
<br />[17:18] &lt;rboren&gt; Do it like the Meetup page, show last hunt and next hunt.
<br />[17:18] &lt;rboren&gt; An IRC log for a bug hunt would be a monster though.&#160;:-)
<br />[17:20] * Joins: Libertus
<br />[17:20] &lt;rboren&gt; I can update it and propose the next date.  Say on the weekend in a couple of weeks?
<br />[17:21] &lt;io_error&gt; That would be the 22nd?
<br />[17:21] &lt;rboren&gt; YEp.
<br />[17:21] &lt;rboren&gt; During that Saturday?
<br />[17:21] &lt;io_error&gt; That should do.
<br />[17:22] &lt;rboren&gt; Alright.
<br />[17:22] &lt;io_error&gt; And quote times in UTC so people don't get confused again&#160;:)
<br />[17:22] &lt;rboren&gt; Well I provided that nifty time and date link.&#160;:-)
<br />[17:23] &lt;skeltoac_lappy&gt; and make sure midnight is the first minute of the day, not the last&#160;:)
<br />[17:23] &lt;io_error&gt; skeltoac_lappy: I can't do anythinga bout that.
<br />[17:24] &lt;skeltoac_lappy&gt; argue for your limitations and sure enough, you have them&#160;;-)
<br />[17:24] &lt;mumbles&gt; utc and gmt
<br />[17:25] &lt;rboren&gt; Does that cover Bug Hunt stuff?  I'll update the codex page and be sure to use UTC.
<br />[17:26] &lt;rboren&gt; Okay then.  Anything else?
<br />[17:27] &lt;io_error&gt; I'm fresh out of ideas.
<br />[17:28] &lt;rboren&gt; Okay, let's call it.
<br />[17:28] &lt;rboren&gt; &lt;/meetup&gt;

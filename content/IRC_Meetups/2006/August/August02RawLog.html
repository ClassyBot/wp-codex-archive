[5:00pm] MarkJaquith: Anything I can do for WordCamp?  Anything you want me to bring?<br />
[5:00pm] • skeltoac_lappy asks rboren across the table<br />
[5:00pm] Podz joined the chat room.<br />
[5:00pm] skeltoac_lappy: Give a ring the minute you arrive. We might kidnap you for a coding session at the Automattic Bungalow.<br />
[5:01pm] skeltoac_lappy: 707-364-0385 is rboren's number<br />
[5:01pm] stevecooley joined the chat room.<br />
[5:01pm] MarkJaquith: Okay.  I'll be settled in by about 2pm or so tomorrow.<br />
[5:01pm] skeltoac_lappy: The first item on the agenda today is an unidentified security hole.<br />
[5:02pm] skeltoac_lappy: rboren says it's already fixed in 2.0.4<br />
[5:02pm] MarkJaquith: I know of two major ones fixed in 2.0.4<br />
[5:02pm] MarkJaquith: the one I found, and the one Dr. Dave posted about.<br />
[5:02pm] skeltoac_lappy: fixed is fixed.<br />
[5:02pm] mumblesblah joined the chat room.<br />
[5:02pm] skeltoac_lappy: If that Geoffe character isn't here (not gsnedders) I guess it's a non-issue.<br />
[5:03pm] gsnedders: I'm here.<br />
[5:03pm] skeltoac_lappy: not you <br />
[5:03pm] • gsnedders didn't read <br />
[5:03pm] mumblesblah is now known as mumbles.<br />
[5:03pm] skeltoac_lappy: Any other issues for this meetup?<br />
[5:03pm] gsnedders: Geoffrey is my name on the wiki, IIRC<br />
[5:04pm] MarkJaquith: skeltoac_lappy: he may just have been referring to the one brought up on the list<br />
[5:05pm] skeltoac_lappy: Oh, the one that requires admin access? <br />
[5:05pm] MarkJaquith: ... hm, or it could be the Dr. Dave one<br />
[5:05pm] skeltoac_lappy: Whichever, we're not dealing with it.<br />
[5:05pm] stevecooley: ah jeez, I just updated the meetup codex page, but I think I screwed up the formatting a bit<br />
[5:05pm] mumbles: whops<br />
[5:05pm] mumbles: forgot the meetup this week<br />
[5:05pm] stevecooley: well, it's probably just not organized the way it should be<br />
[5:05pm] skeltoac_lappy: Wordcamp Update<br />
[5:05pm] stevecooley: yep!<br />
[5:05pm] skeltoac_lappy: okay<br />
[5:05pm] skeltoac_lappy: It's happening, we have the venue, we're rounding up cows for the slaughter...<br />
[5:06pm] MarkJaquith: Would be nice to have a WordCamp mailing list or forum so people who are going to be in town early can hook up<br />
[5:06pm] stevecooley: it's just starting to feel like a break-in rave, what with the details being so sparse <br />
[5:06pm] skeltoac_lappy: Before we had hundreds of signups I asked Matt if we'd eat his weight in BBQ. There are no doubts now.<br />
[5:06pm] skeltoac_lappy: I think we're going to use Dodgeball<br />
[5:06pm] MarkJaquith: Heh, what's he, a buck fifty?  Won't be a problem<br />
[5:07pm] skeltoac_lappy: I don't know what else<br />
[5:07pm] skeltoac_lappy: #wordcamp<br />
[5:07pm] stevecooley: Where's the venue?<br />
[5:07pm] stevecooley: what time? <br />
[5:07pm] skeltoac_lappy: The Swedish American Hall<br />
[5:07pm] skeltoac_lappy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://wordcamp.org">http://wordcamp.org</a><br />
[5:08pm] stevecooley: Yeah, two days ago it used to say swedish american hall<br />
[5:08pm] skeltoac_lappy: oops<br />
[5:08pm] stevecooley: yesterday... (checking now) it didn't say that anymore<br />
[5:08pm] MarkJaquith: Hrm, why would Matt take that down?<br />
[5:08pm] skeltoac_lappy: Email should have gone out by now<br />
[5:08pm] skeltoac_lappy: I'll nag Matt about it<br />
[5:08pm] stevecooley: Quote the page: "Where?<br />
[5:08pm] stevecooley:     Someplace in San Francisco, CA. Suggestions?"<br />
[5:08pm] skeltoac_lappy: Yeah, I see that.<br />
[5:08pm] skeltoac_lappy: It's Swedish American Hall.<br />
[5:09pm] MarkJaquith: Internet situation... wireless, or should we bring a few routers?<br />
[5:10pm] skeltoac_lappy: We're supposed to have wifi<br />
[5:10pm] skeltoac_lappy: Maybe an EVDO router<br />
[5:10pm] skeltoac_lappy: says bazza<br />
[5:10pm] stevecooley: 400 laptops all hungry for DHCP and a power outlet<br />
[5:11pm] skeltoac_lappy: Yeah... it's going to be like an early Gnomedex. <br />
[5:11pm] skeltoac_lappy: Bring power strips.<br />
[5:11pm] • MarkJaquith will bring Treo for backup<br />
[5:11pm] skeltoac_lappy: I'm not bringing my laptop <br />
[5:11pm] stevecooley: and it's still free?  Those swedish americans are gonna go Viking on us<br />
[5:11pm] skeltoac_lappy: Bring armor. We'll have a Cleric there to bless it... +1 against Vikings at least. <br />
[5:12pm] skeltoac_lappy: Still free.<br />
[5:12pm] skeltoac_lappy: We got a load of generous sponsors <br />
[5:12pm] MarkJaquith: I think you could pass out a tip jar and a lot of people would chip in... if there aren't enough sponsors to keep it running in the black.<br />
[5:12pm] MarkJaquith: oh yeah?  pretty good for short notice<br />
[5:12pm] stevecooley: free as in As-free-as-being-in-SF-can-be-free<br />
[5:12pm] MarkJaquith: stevecooley: free, but $30 for parking<br />
[5:12pm] stevecooley: exactly <br />
[5:13pm] skeltoac_lappy: Take BART <br />
[5:13pm] MarkJaquith: yeah, BART lets off less than a mile away<br />
[5:13pm] MarkJaquith: 16th and mission, I think<br />
[5:13pm] stevecooley: I would if bart went down to san jose<br />
[5:13pm] stevecooley: caltrain to a bus, maybe<br />
[5:13pm] stevecooley: or two<br />
[5:14pm] mumbles: use public transport you lacey lot<br />
[5:14pm] mumbles: lazey ^<br />
[5:14pm] bazza: $30 for parking or $50 for a parking ticket -- your choice<br />
[5:15pm] skeltoac_lappy: Half of Automattic is waiting for this meetup to end so we can all go to lunch... What else do we need to cover?<br />
[5:16pm] MarkJaquith: skeltoac_lappy: any decision on topics yet?  multiple forums going on at once or one-size-fits-all?<br />
[5:16pm] skeltoac_lappy: I think Matt's waiting for another day or two, voting-wise.<br />
[5:16pm] skeltoac_lappy: I'll nag him about it.<br />
[5:16pm] • skeltoac_lappy write it down<br />
[5:17pm] MarkJaquith: We can brain storm Thursday or Friday<br />
[5:17pm] • mumbles still wants an england wordcamp <br />

[17:06] <photomatt> <meetup>
<br />[17:06] <photomatt> first topic, bug hunt!
<br />[17:06] <photomatt> take it away, mr boren
<br />[17:07] <rboren> Yeah, let's, like, do one.
<br />[17:07] <rboren> Could be combines 2.0.4 and 2.1.
<br />[17:08] <rboren> Both are pretty usable right now.
<br />[17:08] * Joins: mdawaffe
<br />[17:09] <rboren> Suggestions for date/time?
<br />[17:09] <photomatt> are both milestones pretty clean in terms of what's left to do?
<br />[17:09] <rboren> 2.0.4 is pretty settled.
<br />[17:09] <photomatt> how about next tuesday or wednseday?
<br />[17:09] <rboren> 2.1 doesn't have much outstanding.
<br />[17:09] <rboren> Sounds good.
<br />[17:10] <rboren> Do it on meetup day and then have a progress report during the meetup.
<br />[17:10] <rboren> We need to update the bug hunt page to mention 2.04. and 2.1.
<br />[17:10] <rboren> And update the date.
<br />[17:10] <Podz> forum post?
<br />[17:11] <rboren> Yep.
<br />[17:11] <Podz> wil do
<br />[17:11] <photomatt> dev blog post?
<br />[17:11] <photomatt> would probably get more exposure
<br />[17:11] <rboren> Sure, we keep saying we need to use that thing.
<br />[17:11] <photomatt> and the dev blog needs an update anyway
<br />[17:11] <photomatt> get that april fools off there
<br />[17:11] <photomatt> rboren: can you check that you have publish on the dev blog?
<br />[17:14] <rboren> Can't even login in right now.
<br />[17:15] <rboren> Been awhile since I tried.
<br />[17:17] <photomatt> okay we can figure that out
<br />[17:18] <rboren> So, we need to update the codex page, make forum and dev blog announcements, make snapshots for both 2.0.4 and 2.1, and ...?
<br />[17:18] <photomatt> try a password reset
<br />[17:19] <ringmaster> Look!  A pterodactyl!
<br />[17:20] <rboren> I'm in.
<br />[17:20] <photomatt> heh
<br />[17:20] <photomatt> okay
<br />[17:24] <rboren> I'll take care of all of the bug hunt stuff.  What's next?
<br />[17:24] <photomatt> a topic from MarkJ, but he's not around
<br />[17:25] <ringmaster> I think the topic is familiar enough to cover at least briefly to get people here to think on it.
<br />[17:26] <ringmaster> It's regarding http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2531 and photomatt's suggestions for altering the caps system.
<br />[17:28] <ringmaster> Having had the discussion a few times on IRC and via some email and Trac, I agree with Mark on two points: That the current system can be made to work well, and that hardcoding caps/roles into the core is a bad idea.
<br />[17:28] <photomatt> okay
<br />[17:30] <photomatt> anybody want to comment on that?
<br />[17:31] <ringmaster> Since no further comment has been made on it by core devs as to what the road ahead is, nobody has been producing any code in that area.
<br />[17:31] <rboren> I'm a bit too tired to think about it.  I do think it can wait for 2.2 where we can make it a focus.
<br />[17:32] <ringmaster> rboren: That seems a reasonable course of action, even if there are a few things left undone that we could do for 2.1, such as the caps2users/user2caps suggestion Mark had.
<br />[17:33] <rboren> Right.  I kinda just want to firm up 2.1 and get it before it slips to far into the year.
<br />[17:33] <rboren> get it out
<br />[17:35] * Quits: skippy ("Leaving"ï¿½)
<br />[17:36] <ringmaster> Ok, so no changes for 2.1 then.  And then we can discuss what 2.2 might hold?
<br />[17:37] <rboren> Sounds good.
<br />[17:37] <rboren> Everybody cogitate and be ready.
<br />[17:38] <ringmaster> I don't think it will pain Mark to hear that.  And that's all I have to say today.  :)

<br />[17:39] <undersigned> meetup over?
<br />[17:39] <PotterSys> undersigned: almost
<br />[17:39] <undersigned> mkay
<br />[17:39] <undersigned> :)
<br />[17:39] <rboren> I tweaked the Bug Hunt page a bit.  Feel free to make it prettier.  If you want to help host the hunt put your name in the "IRC Bug Hunt Hosts" section.
<br />[17:39] <rboren> http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Bug_Hunts
<br />[17:39] <photomatt> yeah I don't really feel like talking about caps either
<br />[17:40] <photomatt> rboren: cool
<br />[17:40] <photomatt> rboren: why don't we start with a ping to wp-hackers
<br />[17:40] <photomatt> a post to dev blog tomorrow should still be enough time
<br />[17:40] <photomatt> it can be a 24-hour event
<br />[17:41] <rboren> Hopefully those in the US won't be too burnt out from July 4th the previous day.
<br />[17:41] <ringmaster> photomatt: At some point talking about caps will become necessary though, and I hope that it gets discussed instead of mandated by dev fiat.
<br />[17:42] <photomatt> it's not really a discussion when people are stubborn, so yes, I hope it is discussed
<br />[17:42] <ringmaster> Well, when you stop being stubborn and discuss it, that'll be cool.
<br />[17:42] <photomatt> you're quite the charmer
<br />[17:43] <photomatt> anything else for the meetup?
<br />[17:43] <ringmaster> Anything else we can ignore?  Why bother.
<br />[17:43] * Parts: ringmaster
<br />[17:44] <photomatt> on that note
<br />[17:44] <photomatt> let's call it
<br />[17:44] <undersigned> :)
<br />[17:44] <undersigned> yay, got my smiley in the logs
<br />[17:44] <photomatt> actually one more thing
<br />[17:45] <photomatt> undersigned: could you talk briefly about the theme comp you are thinking about?
<br />[17:45] <undersigned> sure :)
<br />[17:45] <undersigned> i have written a blog post at http://theundersigned.net/2006/06/wordpress-theme-competition/
<br />[17:46] <undersigned> i have taken some time to contact different companies etc, to collect prizes enough to create a good prize pool for a new theme competition
<br />[17:46] <photomatt> why do you think the last theme comp failed, and how will this one be better?
<br />[17:46] <undersigned> i think the wp community is great etc etc - but i have been really dissapointed over the last two competitions
<br />[17:47] <undersigned> the first was fake, the second was unorganized, and as far as i have heard, many of the prizes sponsored for the last competition was never claimed from the sponsors
<br />[17:47] <undersigned> the last competition included both previously released themes, theme mods and a design rip, and i missed a lot more organizing :/
<br />[17:48] <undersigned> well.. David posted this on bloggingpro.com: http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2006/06/23/wordpress-slowdown-and-a-challenge/
<br />[17:48] <undersigned> and i agree
<br />[17:49] <undersigned> i planned the competition before that post, but it tells me that others think the same :/
<br />[17:49] <photomatt> gotcha
<br />[17:49] <photomatt> I agree the last one was a bit of a disappointment
<br />[17:49] <photomatt> it's a ton of time commitment, are you up for it?
<br />[17:50] <undersigned> i am working out a rule set (no themes based on other themes - mods, no pre-released themes, semantic markup/valid design as far as possible etc)
<br />[17:50] <undersigned> well, i already use a lot of time keeping the theme viewer clean from duplicates, and updating themes for people etc
<br />[17:50] <undersigned> i get 10-20 mails from the theme viewer form every day
<br />[17:50] <undersigned> i guess this wouldn't be near as hectic :)
<br />[17:51] <photomatt> what can be done to make this round even more kick-ass?
<br />[17:51] <undersigned> better prize pool will encourage more to join
<br />[17:52] <undersigned> im trying to create interest by blogging a little about it etc.
<br />[17:53] <undersigned> the prizes so far is quantity, but no real catches.. we are talking licenses for various apps, books, 1-year hosting offers, icon buffet downloads etc
<br />[17:53] <tunicwriter> Maybe since you guys do want to use that handy dev blog of yours, you can kick up some interest using that, too...
<br />[17:54] <photomatt> I like the sound of that
<br />[17:54] <photomatt> also I like that this one is being run by someone who is known within the WP community, I still feel silly about blogging that first theme comp
<br />[17:54] <undersigned> i am still contacting people and hope to get some good prizes.. competition will be covered on both the theme viewer and my blog .. = avg 5000+ unique daily visitors.. sponsors will indeed get publicity
<br />[17:55] <undersigned> thx matt :)
<br />[17:55] <photomatt> I'd be happy to kick in some sponsorship
<br />[17:55] <undersigned> fantastic!
<br />[17:56] <undersigned> david from bloggingpro might sponsor some too he mentioned, as well as cover it
<br />[17:56] <undersigned> i have contacts within the UK .net magazine too
<br />[17:56] <undersigned> and am in contact with layermagazine
<br />[17:57] <undersigned> i hope these will help too ;)
<br />[17:57] <photomatt> sounds very nice
<br />[17:57] <photomatt> there aren't really any theme changes coming in 2.1
<br />[17:57] <photomatt> except for themes which directly query the posts DB
<br />[17:57] <photomatt> encouraging themes to be forward-compatible would be highly recommended
<br />[17:57] <undersigned> great
<br />[17:57] <undersigned> i will write that down
<br />[17:58] <photomatt> we haven't really made a decision about rolling in widgets yet or not
<br />[17:58] <undersigned> btw.. since 17th of june there has been over 72000 theme downloads from the viewer
<br />[17:59] <undersigned> ok, my personal opinion is go for it..
<br />[17:59] <undersigned> but i will encourage widget compatibility and plugin-wreapping anyways though
<br />[17:59] <photomatt> undersigned: I don't know if you saw, but I made the links to the theme viewer very prominent
<br />[17:59] <photomatt> on the extend page, for example
<br />[18:00] <undersigned> yea really nice!
<br />[18:02] <undersigned> what do you think about the wp.com prize idea..?
<br />[18:02] <photomatt> alrighty
<br />[18:02] <photomatt> any other topics?
<br />[18:03] <PotterSys> none here...
<br />[18:04] <undersigned> nope
<br />[18:06] <photomatt> okay!

<br />[17:01] <photomatt_lap> so I would like to thank PotterSys and Ryan for helping out on the internationalization of bbPress
<br />[17:01] <stevecooley> *high fives*
<br />[17:01] <photomatt_lap> it's done
<br />[17:01] <photomatt_lap> haha
<br />[17:01] <PotterSys> you're welcome :)
<br />[17:02] <photomatt_lap> any other topics?
<br />[17:02] <stevecooley> very cool!  was it internationalization in the sense that it has templates that allow for localization packs or something like that?
<br />[17:03] <photomatt_lap> yep, so we can now offer international forums for different language groups
<br />[17:03] <stevecooley> way cool :)

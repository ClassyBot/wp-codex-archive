<p>[19:06] &lt;SteveAgl&gt; the speacher is still away...
<br />[19:06] &lt;skippy&gt; screw it.  let's get started.
<br />[19:07] &lt;SteveAgl&gt; the agenda #1 is:
<br />[19:07] &lt;SteveAgl&gt; Committors: is bg|commit still useful? It seems nowadays that Matt/Ryan just work their way through open bugs and I can't seem to find much correlation between bugs I/we've tagged as bg|commit and actual ones committed. DavidHouse
<br />[19:14] &lt;skippy&gt; well, since photomatt_away isn't here, and I don't see ryan, let's put that on hold.
<br />[19:14] * Joins: mikelittle
<br />[19:14] &lt;skippy&gt; and we need commiters to talk about the next item, too.
<br />[19:14] * Joins: masq|lappy
<br />[19:14] &lt;skippy&gt; so, moving on to item #3...
<br />[19:14] * Joins: skeltoac
<br />[19:14] &lt;skippy&gt; only photomatt_away can talk about the problems with the forums.
<br />[19:15] &lt;skippy&gt; so, we're done.  thanks for coming, everyone.  productive meeting, as usual.
<br />[19:15] * Joins: SteamedPenguin
<br />[19:15] &lt;skeltoac&gt; Sorry I showed up late. Can I help with anything?
<br />[19:15] &lt;MichaelH&gt; good job skippy&#160;;)
<br />[19:15] &lt;skippy&gt; is bg|commit a helpful tag, skeltoac&#160;?
<br />[19:15] &lt;skippy&gt; and do you review the list of user-flagged commit candidates?
<br />[19:16] * Joins: rboren
<br />[19:16] &lt;skeltoac&gt; I don't commit patches so I can't answer the first question. I pinged Ryan to jump in here so maybe he can...
<br />[19:16] &lt;skeltoac&gt; there he is&#160;:)
<br />[19:16] &lt;skeltoac&gt; rboren: is bg_commit useful?
<br />[19:17] &lt;rboren&gt; Yes, I look at it when I go on commit runs.
<br />[19:18] &lt;skeltoac&gt; skippy: as to your second question, I only review patches when someone asks for my opinion on them.
<br />[19:19] &lt;skippy&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://trac.wordpress.org/report/9">http://trac.wordpress.org/report/9</a>  &lt;-- is the grouping on that helpful?  Or would a date-based list be more appropriate?
<br />[19:20] &lt;rboren&gt; By date might be better.
<br />[19:20] * Joins: ringmaster
<br />[19:22] &lt;skippy&gt; updated the report.  let me know if it's broken, or ineffective in any wya
<br />[19:23] &lt;SteveAgl&gt; where are the trac tag documented?
<br />[19:24] &lt;skippy&gt; i don't know that they are.
<br />[19:24] &lt;skippy&gt; for a while, it was mostly MarkJ and I adding tags ourselves.
<br />[19:24] &lt;skippy&gt; they're all pretty self-explanatory:  bg|needs-patch, bg|has-patch, bg|2nd-opinion, bg|commit
<br />[19:24] &lt;skippy&gt; the bg| prefix means "bug gardener"
<br />[19:25] &lt;SteveAgl&gt; oh ok&#160;:)
<br />[19:25] &lt;skeltoac&gt; bg|reporter-feedback but reporters rarely come back to check.
<br />[19:25] &lt;SteveAgl&gt; was the bg part not understood by me&#160;:)
<br />[19:25] &lt;skippy&gt; we could probably drop that, going forward.
<br />[19:26] &lt;skippy&gt; then modify the reports to not use that in the query.
<br />[19:27] &lt;skippy&gt; any objections to dropping the bg| prefix&#160;?
<br />[19:28] &lt;skeltoac&gt; Not so much.
<br />[19:28] &lt;skippy&gt; so the "commit" tag is still useful.  That's good to know
<br />[19:29] &lt;skippy&gt; we need photomatt_away to address the Codex problem.  Anyone have anything else to discuss?

<br />[19:30] * Joins: shep
<br />[19:30] &lt;skippy&gt; any feedback on inline documentation (PHPdoc)&#160;?
<br />[19:31] &lt;shep&gt; i'm here. we can start
<br />[19:31] * Quits: gsnedders
<br />[19:31] &lt;davidhouse&gt; skippy, i'd like to see it.
<br />[19:31] &lt;davidhouse&gt; lets not go overboard.
<br />[19:31] &lt;davidhouse&gt; one or two lines before every function is about righ.
<br />[19:31] &lt;SteveAgl&gt; would be nice to have
<br />[19:32] * Parts: ringmaster
<br />[19:32] &lt;skippy&gt; okay.  rboren: would you commit patches that contained nothing but comments?
<br />[19:32] &lt;shep&gt; i have a quick question. a feature request that i thought was supposed to be addressed in 2.0
<br />[19:32] &lt;SteamedPenguin&gt; davidhouse: there are benefits to PHPDoc, as in autogenerating the documentation periodically. makes it easier to export too
<br />[19:32] &lt;rboren&gt; Depends on what they were commenting...
<br />[19:33] &lt;rboren&gt; IF breaking down a tricky regex, probably.
<br />[19:33] &lt;davidhouse&gt; SteamedPenguin: henec my support.
<br />[19:33] &lt;shep&gt; is saving a page as a draft ever going to be included in WP?
<br />[19:33] &lt;skeltoac&gt; shep: it's in.
<br />[19:33] &lt;SteamedPenguin&gt; rboren: that's sounds like an 'if and only if'
<br />[19:34] &lt;shep&gt; skeltoac: in 2.0.1?
<br />[19:34] &lt;rboren&gt; Well, if the comment is a bunch of boilerplate, probably not.
<br />[19:34] &lt;davidhouse&gt; shep, no, 2.1
<br />[19:34] &lt;rboren&gt; But, it's a philosophical discussion.
<br />[19:34] &lt;davidhouse&gt; my commenting policy:
<br />[19:34] &lt;davidhouse&gt; one line summary before every function
<br />[19:34] &lt;davidhouse&gt; comment when you do something voodoo
<br />[19:34] &lt;davidhouse&gt; comment when you begin a big chunk of code (say a big loop)
<br />[19:35] &lt;SteamedPenguin&gt; rboren: so something like var listing and var typing would not go in?
<br />[19:35] &lt;davidhouse&gt; that's it.
<br />[19:35] &lt;skippy&gt; I was once encouraged (elsewhere) to only comment the extraordinary and non-obvious; but that sets an ambiguous standard.  Obvious to the person who wrote it is often non-obvious to the newbie
<br />[19:36] &lt;rboren&gt; SteamedPenguin:  I wouldn't right now, but we can discuss on the hackers list and see where people fall.
<br />[19:37] &lt;skeltoac&gt; The major argument I see opposed to extensive commenting is that it takes time to review them.
<br />[19:38] &lt;SteamedPenguin&gt; skeltoac: a fair ammount of function description can come straight out of the codex.
<br />[19:38] &lt;SteamedPenguin&gt; at least where template tags are concerned
<br />[19:40] &lt;SteamedPenguin&gt; skeltoac: since that stuff has the most eyeballs it ought to be the first target for inline commenting as well as the easiest to accomplish
<br />[19:40] &lt;SteamedPenguin&gt; making template tags a good test case, IMO
<br />[19:42] &lt;skeltoac&gt; You can always upload patches and ask for peer review. If you have a good set of comments and they've been okayed by a number of devs, Ryan doesn't have to spend his day reading them over.
<br />[19:42] &lt;skeltoac&gt; (I hope, anyway.)
<br />[19:44] &lt;SteamedPenguin&gt; skeltoac: ok, I'll make a simple patch tomorrow then.
<br />[19:45] * Quits: SteveAgl (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)�)
<br />[19:45] * Parts: shep
<br />[19:46] * Parts: skippy ("Free as in Puppies!"�)
<br />[19:47] &lt;mumbles&gt; shoudlent that be &lt;/endmeetup&gt;

<p>[19:01] &lt;rboren&gt; Fiat meetup.
<br />[19:01] &lt;rboren&gt; &lt;meetup&gt;
<br />[19:01] &lt;rboren&gt; Nothing on the agenda.
<br />[19:01] &lt;rboren&gt; Who's got something?
<br />[19:02] &lt;stevecooley&gt; great meetup
<br />[19:02] &lt;rboren&gt; Okay, I'll go.
<br />[19:02] &lt;rboren&gt; 2.0.2 is coming soon.
<br />[19:03] &lt;rboren&gt; Security release.
<br />[19:03] &lt;rboren&gt; Haven't had much feedback from the testers list.
<br />[19:03] &lt;rboren&gt; So it's either flawless or no one cares.&#160;:-)
<br />[19:03] &lt;stevecooley&gt; Ship it!
<br />[19:03] &lt;rboren&gt; I'm going to run a few last sanity checks and then we'll probably do just that.
<br />[19:04] &lt;ringmaster&gt; regression testing++
<br />[19:04] &lt;MichaelH&gt; Comment on forum that it's getting reviewed for security.  Is that true.
<br />[19:04] &lt;rboren&gt; Folks on the wordpress-dev channel combed through it a bit.
<br />[19:04] &lt;rboren&gt; Looking for missing referer checks and such.
<br />[19:04] &lt;_johannes&gt; where do I add me to the testers list?&#160;;-)
<br />[19:05] &lt;MichaelH&gt; _johannes: look here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists">http://codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists</a>

<br />[19:07] &lt;_johannes&gt; thx
<br />[19:07] &lt;rboren&gt; Any 2.0.2 questions?
<br />[19:08] &lt;MichaelH&gt; Expected ship?
<br />[19:08] &lt;rboren&gt; This week maybe.
<br />[19:08] &lt;MichaelH&gt; Thanks.
<br />[19:09] &lt;rboren&gt; Lot's of people are traveling for SxSW...
<br />[19:09] &lt;rboren&gt; So we might put it off a bit so everyone can settle.
<br />[19:10] &lt;MichaelH&gt; Here's the comment about security review in the forums: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/64071?replies=2">http://wordpress.org/support/topic/64071?replies=2</a>
<br />[19:10] &lt;rboren&gt; I think he asked some folks with security expertise to look it over.
<br />[19:10] &lt;rboren&gt; I don't know the details.
<br />[19:11] &lt;rboren&gt; He's trapped in a meeting right now.
<br />[19:12] &lt;MichaelH&gt; Ok
<br />[19:12] &lt;rboren&gt; Show and tell time?
<br />[19:12] &lt;rboren&gt; Who's working on a fun WP project?
<br />[19:12] &lt;MichaelH&gt; Most of Codex available in MediaWiki 1.5.7 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2006-March/001307.html">http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2006-March/001307.html</a>
<br />[19:13] &lt;rboren&gt; Nice.
<br />[19:13] * Joins: mahangu
<br />[19:14] * Joins: Podz
<br />[19:14] &lt;rboren&gt; Anyone else? ringmaster, skeltoac: You guys are always working on something.
<br />[19:14] &lt;ringmaster&gt; I've been sick this weekend. &#160;:(
<br />[19:15] &lt;ringmaster&gt; So just a new theme for my own site between coughing up a lung. &#160;:)
<br />[19:15] &lt;gsnedders&gt; I've got myalgic encephalomyelitis&#160;:(
<br />[19:15] * ringmaster fears gsnedders' disease.
<br />[19:15] &lt;gsnedders&gt;&#160;:P
<br />[19:16] &lt;skeltoac&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://andy.wordpress.com/2006/03/08/widgets-user-interface-and-api">http://andy.wordpress.com/2006/03/08/widgets-user-interface-and-api</a>
<br />[19:16] &lt;skeltoac&gt; For once I came up with a UI that I like.
<br />[19:16] &lt;rboren&gt;&#160;:-)
<br />[19:16] &lt;rboren&gt; I leave UI to others.
<br />[19:17] &lt;gsnedders&gt; heh. I can design good UIs, but I can't make it look nice&#160;:)
<br />[19:17] &lt;rboren&gt; I can't do either.
<br />[19:18] &lt;skeltoac&gt; When you can code like you can, you don't worry about it&#160;:)
<br />[19:18] &lt;gsnedders&gt; I can't design anything.
<br />[19:18] &lt;ringmaster&gt; So... I'm still trying to figure out how this widget thing works.  Can you just put HTML in it or what?
<br />[19:18] &lt;skeltoac&gt; ringmaster: I'll let you peek at the source code. PM?
<br />[19:18] &lt;ringmaster&gt; k.
<br />[19:19] &lt;rboren&gt; As for me, I've got the Secure Admin plugin working pretty well.
<br />[19:19] &lt;rboren&gt; SSL to your admin pages...
<br />[19:19] &lt;rboren&gt; Encrypted cookies.
<br />[19:21] &lt;ringmaster&gt; I haven't had a chance to check it out yet, but I have a question:  Will it work with cross-domain SSL?  For example...
<br />[19:21] &lt;ringmaster&gt; If my site is at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>  but I use the SSL at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://myhostsserver/~example/">https://myhostsserver/~example/</a> will it still work?
<br />[19:22] &lt;rboren&gt; Right now it's pretty simplistic, so probably not.
<br />[19:22] &lt;rboren&gt; Should be able to work that in though.
<br />[19:23] &lt;ringmaster&gt; This is a common scenario with hosts like Site5, and would be pretty useful.
<br />[19:23] &lt;rboren&gt; Yes.
<br />[19:24] &lt;rboren&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://flickr.com/photos/photomatt/108941869/">http://flickr.com/photos/photomatt/108941869/</a>

<br />[19:24] &lt;rboren&gt; Every project has to have schwag.
<br />[19:24] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Spiffy. &#160;:)
<br />[19:25] * gsnedders wonders whether to get one...
<br />[19:25] * gsnedders wonders if I'm _that_ geeky&#160;:P
<br />[19:26] &lt;gsnedders&gt; I'd probably need a small&#160;:D
<br />[19:27] * gsnedders needs to put on some weight, and be less underweight
<br />[19:27] &lt;gsnedders&gt; maybe move my computer into the kitchen&#160;:D
<br />[19:28] &lt;gsnedders&gt; wow. gone real quiet.
<br />[19:28] &lt;rboren&gt; Thinking of food.&#160;:-)
<br />[19:28] * PotterSys wants to sell some pounds to gsnedders&#160;:P
<br />[19:29] &lt;gsnedders&gt; rboren, well, I guess it's time for me to watch the news, grab something to eat, then go to sleep
<br />[19:29] &lt;gsnedders&gt; g'night all!
<br />[19:29] &lt;rboren&gt; g'night
<br />[19:29] * Quits: gsnedders
<br />[19:29] &lt;rboren&gt; Anything else to discuss?
<br />[19:29] &lt;Podz&gt; can i ask something about 1.5.3&#160;?
<br />[19:30] &lt;rboren&gt; Fire away.
<br />[19:30] &lt;Podz&gt; will it be a full package or just set of replacement files&#160;? The latter could be good&#160;?
<br />[19:31] &lt;rboren&gt; We can list the changed files so people can pick and choose, if they like.
<br />[19:31] &lt;Podz&gt; the latter would encourage upgrading but let us die-hards stay where we are
<br />[19:31] &lt;rboren&gt; We can also provide a diff for those who know patch.
<br />[19:32] &lt;Podz&gt; it's just if 1.5 is to not branch away, then a files only download would help keep things focussed on 2
<br />[19:32] &lt;Podz&gt; maybe&#160;:)
<br />[19:32] &lt;Podz&gt; nut my main reason for asking was forum support. Two releases = lots of questions from existing 1.5 users
<br />[19:33] &lt;rboren&gt; Encourage 2.02 but say here's 1.5.3 if you just can't let go.
<br />[19:33] &lt;rboren&gt; 1.5.3 still allows all users to post unfiltered html.
<br />[19:34] &lt;rboren&gt; Backporting that from 2.0 would turn 1.5 into 2.0.
<br />[19:34] &lt;rboren&gt; Which defeats the point of providing a 1.5 update.
<br />[19:34] &lt;Podz&gt; and that's fair enough
<br />[19:35] &lt;rboren&gt; Those who allow anyone to register should upgrade to 2.0.
<br />[19:35] &lt;Podz&gt; That'll be made clear - ta for that
<br />[19:36] &lt;Podz&gt; eta&#160;? roughly&#160;?
<br />[19:36] &lt;rboren&gt; At the same time as 2.0.2, probably.  I think we have one more fix to backport.
<br />[19:37] &lt;Podz&gt; minutes&#160;? tomorrow&#160;?
<br />[19:37] &lt;rboren&gt; Let's say look for both in the next several days. Could be sooner.
<br />[19:37] &lt;Podz&gt; need to write the forum posts and tell mods
<br />[19:37] &lt;Podz&gt; okay&#160;:) thanks
<br />[19:37] &lt;rboren&gt; Feedback on the 2.0.2 release candidates has been almost non-existent.
<br />[19:38] &lt;rboren&gt; So I'm trying to browbeat people into testing before we release.
<br />[19:39] &lt;Podz&gt; which must be annoying
<br />[19:39] &lt;rboren&gt; It's a typical problem.  Most testing doesn't happen until after release...
<br />[19:39] &lt;rboren&gt; because everyone understandably wants to wait for the final.
<br />[19:40] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Having a better idea of what to test might be helpful.
<br />[19:40] &lt;rboren&gt; I posted the bug list.
<br />[19:40] * Quits: mahangu ("Leaving"ï¿½)
<br />[19:40] * ringmaster looks around, and wonders how he missed that.
<br />[19:40] * Quits: stevecooley
<br />[19:41] &lt;rboren&gt; And in most cases, people just loading it up and using it is very helpful.
<br />[19:42] &lt;rboren&gt; Anyhow, I've got one of my testbeds running 2.0.2.
<br />[19:42] &lt;rboren&gt; Tested the security vulnerabilities.
<br />[19:42] &lt;rboren&gt; Did installs and upgrade from 2.0.1.
<br />[19:42] &lt;rboren&gt; Imported 500 posts from both MT and LiveJournal.
<br />[19:43] &lt;rboren&gt; Kicked the tires and so on.
<br />[19:43] &lt;rboren&gt; Works for me.&#160;:-)
<br />[19:43] &lt;rboren&gt; But then it always does.
<br />[19:44] &lt;rboren&gt; Alright, any 2.1 talk?
<br />[19:44] &lt;Podz&gt; with the current testing setup, that's all you can do - and then we do our bit&#160;:)
<br />[19:45] &lt;rboren&gt; I'm cleaning up the template functions...
<br />[19:45] &lt;rboren&gt; wp_dropdown_*(), wp_list_*()...
<br />[19:46] &lt;rboren&gt; Adding more options, cleaning up the backend stuff.
<br />[19:46] &lt;rboren&gt; Deprecating lots of crufty functions.
<br />[19:46] &lt;ringmaster&gt; cruft--
<br />[19:46] &lt;rboren&gt; They have been moved to deprecated.php so we can see just what is deprecated.
<br />[19:47] &lt;rboren&gt; masquerade continued on ringmaster's cron work...
<br />[19:47] &lt;MichaelH&gt; When does deprecated become GONE from the code base?
<br />[19:47] &lt;rboren&gt; Probably never.  There are no plans at present to remove any of them.
<br />[19:48] &lt;rboren&gt; If we get a huge pile of them that ones deprecated longest ago might be removed.
<br />[19:48] &lt;rboren&gt; We could always put them in a separate include and pull them in if someone defines a "USE_DEPRECATED" flag.
<br />[19:48] &lt;rboren&gt; But that's all future.  Right now they are staying.
<br />[19:49] &lt;MichaelH&gt; Darn was looking forward to cutting something out of Codex&#160;;)
<br />[19:50] &lt;rboren&gt; Well, we could separate documentation for deprecated functions and make it clear that these are going extinct and shouldn't be used.
<br />[19:50] &lt;_johannes&gt; would be great
<br />[19:50] &lt;rboren&gt; Most of the functions that were in links.php are now deprecated.
<br />[19:50] &lt;rboren&gt; Following the link management cleanup...
<br />[19:50] &lt;rboren&gt; Which is still ongoing...
<br />[19:51] &lt;rboren&gt; Design is in flux since some don't like the Category consolidation.
<br />[19:51] &lt;rboren&gt; That conversation kind of evaporated though.
<br />[19:52] &lt;_johannes&gt; how much developers approximately are working on Wordpress?
<br />[19:52] &lt;rboren&gt; One feature still in the works is allowing all links or posts in a given category to be hidden.
<br />[19:52] &lt;rboren&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://wordpress.org/about/">http://wordpress.org/about/</a>
<br />[19:52] &lt;ringmaster&gt; I don't get why the cat consolidation happened, but I can live with it.
<br />[19:52] &lt;_johannes&gt; many&#160;:-)
<br />[19:52] &lt;rboren&gt; Regular developers are listed there.
<br />[19:52] &lt;rboren&gt; But there are many more who contribute now and then.
<br />[19:53] &lt;rboren&gt; ringmaster:  We could add a category_type field to separate them out if people prefer that.
<br />[19:53] &lt;rboren&gt; I like having them consolidated, but that's just me...
<br />[19:54] &lt;ringmaster&gt; They're all in one table now, though?  Didn't I see a links2cat discussion somewhere?
<br />[19:54] &lt;rboren&gt; I'm probably influence by the amount of code I got to remove by doing that.
<br />[19:54] &lt;rboren&gt; Yes, links2cat.
<br />[19:54] &lt;rboren&gt; They share categories but we keep separate counts for links and posts.
<br />[19:55] &lt;skeltoac&gt; bookmarks2cat&#160;;-)
<br />[19:55] &lt;rboren&gt; I left "links" in all of the deep backend stuff.
<br />[19:55] &lt;MichaelH&gt; and bookmarks2pages coming soon&#160;;)
<br />[19:55] &lt;skeltoac&gt; hehe
<br />[19:55] &lt;rboren&gt; Especially since we may change it all again if people hate the way it is now.
<br />[19:56] &lt;ringmaster&gt; I'm confused, and I'm not subscribed to the trac feed (where's that, anyway?)  to know what the heck I'm talking about.
<br />[19:56] &lt;rboren&gt; Links can now have more than 1 category, for people who like that.
<br />[19:56] &lt;rboren&gt; Excuse me, bookmarks can...
<br />[19:56] &lt;skeltoac&gt; ringmaster: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://lists.automattic.com">http://lists.automattic.com</a>
<br />[19:56] &lt;MichaelH&gt; or <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-trac">http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-trac</a>
<br />[19:57] &lt;rboren&gt; Basically, when you go to Manage-&gt;Categories, you will see that categories can be assigned to both bookmarks and posts.
<br />[19:57] &lt;rboren&gt; We show the number of bookmarks and the number of posts for each page.
<br />[19:57] &lt;rboren&gt; When you add a link, you have the Add Category stuff in the form, same as with posts.
<br />[19:58] &lt;rboren&gt; So you can create a cat on the fly.
<br />[19:58] &lt;rboren&gt; Personally, I never look at Manage-&gt;Categories.
<br />[19:58] &lt;ringmaster&gt; What bugged me at first was seeing the categories I use for bookmarks on the Write Post page.
<br />[19:58] &lt;rboren&gt; I create cats while assigning them to posts and bookmarks from the create pages.
<br />[19:59] &lt;rboren&gt; Yes.  There is that.  If you don't overlap between the two, you get lots of extra.
<br />[19:59] &lt;rboren&gt; Which could be solved with a "type" field in the category table.
<br />[19:59] &lt;rboren&gt; If we want to go that route.
<br />[19:59] &lt;MichaelH&gt; Don't know if you want to go back to unconsolidated cats after all the hard work so +1 on the category_type if necessary.
<br />[20:00] &lt;rboren&gt; My link and post cats overlapped quite a bit...
<br />[20:00] &lt;ringmaster&gt; I solved the "problem" by moving all of my bookmark cats into a Links top-level cat.
<br />[20:00] * ringmaster shrugs.
<br />[20:00] &lt;rboren&gt; To me, they're all just tags to assign.
<br />[20:01] &lt;rboren&gt; I don't care if they all show up in the same list.
<br />[20:01] &lt;rboren&gt; But, we can hash it out.
<br />[20:02] &lt;rboren&gt; Anything else?
<br />[20:03] &lt;skeltoac&gt; SxSW!
<br />[20:03] &lt;skeltoac&gt; I don't have anything else.
<br />[20:03] &lt;ringmaster&gt; WIsh I still had vacation time left, or I'd be there. &#160;:(
<br />[20:04] &lt;rboren&gt; Automattic will be there stealing ideas, when we're not drunk.
<br />[20:04] &lt;ringmaster&gt; So, basically no ideas will be stolen?
<br />[20:04] &lt;skeltoac&gt; Why not when we're drunk?
<br />[20:05] &lt;rboren&gt; I get and steal my best ideas when drunk.
<br />[20:05] &lt;rboren&gt; And others give up their ideas when drunk.
<br />[20:05] &lt;skeltoac&gt; Mmm, Pinot Noir.
<br />[20:06] &lt;rboren&gt; Indeed.
<br />[20:06] &lt;skeltoac&gt; Looks like a closing tag is in order.
<br />[20:06] &lt;rboren&gt; Yep, why don't do it.
<br />[20:06] &lt;rboren&gt; why don't you do it.
<br />[20:06] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Drunk already.
<br />[20:06] &lt;rboren&gt;&#160;:-)
<br />[20:06] &lt;skeltoac&gt; &lt;/meetup&gt;
<br />[20:06] &lt;skeltoac&gt; Damn WYSIWYG&#160;;-)
<br />[20:07] &lt;rboren&gt; Raquo was here.
<br />[20:07] &lt;skeltoac&gt; haha
<br />[20:07] &lt;skeltoac&gt; &lt;/meetup&gt;
<br />[20:07] &lt;PotterSys&gt; lol
<br />[20:07] &lt;MichaelH&gt; thanks.

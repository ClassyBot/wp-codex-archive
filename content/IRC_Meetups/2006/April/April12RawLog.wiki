<br />[17:00] <mikelittle> Hi
<br />[17:00] * Joins: MenZa
<br />[17:01] <stevecooley> hi :)
<br />[17:01] <MenZa> Huzzah :)
<br />[17:01] <photomatt> alrighty, let's get started
<br />[17:01] <photomatt> <meetup
<br />[17:01] <photomatt> >
<br />[17:01] * Joins: EduardoE
<br />[17:01] <MenZa> Just thought I'd drop in and see how you do these things.
<br />[17:01] <photomatt> well this week we don't have anything too specific on the agenda
<br />[17:01] <photomatt> so it'll be more free-form
<br />[17:02] <photomatt> we can get started with buttons
<br />[17:02] <photomatt> I made two new buttons - http://wordpress.org/about/buttons/
<br />[17:02] <photomatt> but I think we could use more
<br />[17:02] <MenZa> I'll volunteer.
<br />[17:02] <MenZa> I'm not on my Windows box that much, but I do some pretty neat graphics in Photoshop.
<br />[17:02] <mikelittle> "WordPress.org is taking a lunch break."
<br />[17:03] <photomatt> sweet
<br />[17:03] * Joins: io_error
<br />[17:03] <photomatt> mikelittle: a few people overseas have been reporting that
<br />[17:03] <photomatt> it's a DNS problem, but I haven't been able to track it down
<br />[17:03] <Podz> mikelittle, it's not just you! me too
<br />[17:04] <MenZa> photomatt: do you have a vector for the "W" logo you'd be willing to release?
<br />[17:04] <Podz> I can ping continually, just can't see it
<br />[17:04] <photomatt> MenZa: definitely
<br />[17:04] <photomatt> Podz: well you're reaching a box
<br />[17:04] <photomatt> it's just the old box
<br />[17:05] <mumbles> ive been having dns isshues all day for toher sites
<br />[17:05] <Podz> oh..
<br />[17:05] <MenZa> photomatt: sweet. I should be able to create a few great buttons then; for any flavour.
<br />[17:05] <photomatt> wordpress.org should point to 72.232.44.122
<br />[17:05] <photomatt> if it goes to anything else, you'll get that message
<br />[17:07] <MenZa> You know, I was actually thinking, in the platform... submit buttons are much too large - got reminded when you mentioned buttons.
<br />[17:09] <photomatt> anyway we're accepting submissions @ buttons@wordpress.org
<br />[17:09] <photomatt> so if you know anyone graphically inclined, send them in
<br />[17:09] <MenZa> photomatt: any chance you could e-mail that logo then? menza@menza.org
<br />[17:09] <MenZa> I'll produce a few this week.
<br />[17:09] <MenZa> (After all, it is the holidays)
<br />[17:10] <photomatt> http://wordpress.org/style/wp-logo.ai
<br />[17:10] <MenZa> Sweet, thanks
<br />[17:11] <photomatt> the logo is really tricky at smaller sizes
<br />[17:12] <MenZa> photomatt: yeah, a lot of graphics are.
<br />[17:12] <MenZa> I'm not an amazing pixel artist, but I think I can output a few good ones.
<br />[17:12] <io_error> error_bot: dns wordpress.org
<br />[17:12] <error_bot> io_error: 72.232.44.122
<br />[17:15] <photomatt> alrighty
<br />[17:15] <photomatt> any topics anyone wanted to bring up, or should I seed another?
<br />[17:15] <MenZa> photomatt: how about those buttons I mentioned? Submit etc.?
<br />[17:16] <photomatt> as in the application itself?
<br />[17:16] <photomatt> I think their size is fine
<br />[17:16] <MenZa> I find them large and clumsy tbh
<br />[17:16] <MenZa> (brb)
<br />[17:16] <photomatt> they might be a bit different in the new shuttle designs, I don't remember
<br />[17:17] <photomatt> I think they're going "native"
<br />[17:17] <stevecooley> possibly a followup note about themes issue from the last couple of weeks
<br />[17:17] <photomatt> stevecooley: go  for it
<br />[17:17] <stevecooley> I suggested to Undersigned that he become the official keeper of themes since he obviously cares
<br />[17:18] <photomatt> yes?
<br />[17:18] <stevecooley> he's not interested because he feels like he would be restricted from speaking his mind if he saw something about WP he didn't like
<br />[17:18] <stevecooley> http://theundersigned.net/2006/03/wordpress-theme-park/
<br />[17:18] <photomatt> because we censor everyone else? :)
<br />[17:19] <photomatt> generally the most vocal dissenters are people closest to the project
<br />[17:19] <stevecooley> Yeah, you facist!
<br />[17:19] <stevecooley> ;)
<br />[17:19] <stevecooley> well, that's why I don't really understand his thought process there,
<br />[17:19] <stevecooley> it seems like he'd get more done for WP by becoming closer to the team and project
<br />[17:19] <photomatt> I think despite what undersigned may say, he has incentives different than the rest of us
<br />[17:20] <stevecooley> yeah, so, that's that
<br />[17:20] <photomatt> which I would suspect is money, based on the number of ads on the site
<br />[17:20] <stevecooley> he wants to compete, apparently
<br />[17:20] <stevecooley> so, I guess he's going to compete
<br />[17:20] <photomatt> which is okay
<br />[17:20] <MenZa> photomatt: I don't think that's his goal; a bonus, rather. He's got several large sites running, webdesignbook.net, the themepark, his website... in hosting expenses, it all adds upÂ·
<br />[17:20] <stevecooley> totally
<br />[17:20] <photomatt> competition does force us to do a better job :)
<br />[17:21] <photomatt> MenZa: yes but those are all expenses that we have covered
<br />[17:21] <stevecooley> well, that's where it doesn't seem to make sense to me
<br />[17:21] * MenZa shrugs
<br />[17:21] <stevecooley> I mean, maybe we should just subscribe to his feed and return the favor
<br />[17:21] <photomatt> the WP model is mostly, we'll give you all the resources you could possibly need, and get out of the way, just do it in an open source way and give back to the community
<br />[17:21] <stevecooley> Anyway, we know you're going to read this later
<br />[17:22] <stevecooley> yeah, I guess it will all level off in the end
<br />[17:22] <stevecooley> we'll figure out a way to make it work for everyone
<br />[17:22] <photomatt> we have a server set aside just for community folks, btw, if anyone has a project that needs hosting
<br />[17:22] <MenZa> Oh?
<br />[17:23] <photomatt> that's what the plan is behind wordpress.net
<br />[17:23] <MenZa> Wow, kudos to you :O
<br />[17:23] <tunicwriter> Well, there is http://wp-community.org/ that just got started...
<br />[17:23] <photomatt> but the need is less than I expected it to be, because hosting is so cheap these days
<br />[17:23] <photomatt> most people just add-on a domain to what they already have
<br />[17:23] <photomatt> but if the hosting part ever becomes a burden, we're there
<br />[17:25] <MenZa> Honourable.
<br />[17:25] <photomatt> it needs to be fleshed out a bit more
<br />[17:25] <photomatt> it can also be used for other languages - http://nl.wordpress.net/
<br />[17:26] <photomatt> the benefit of it being .net is we don't have to worry about cookie/security issues with .org (or .com)
<br />[17:26] * Joins: undersigned
<br />[17:26] <MenZa> Fancy, photomatt.
<br />[17:26] <mumbles> will lo undersigned
<br />[17:26] <photomatt> we need to figure out a way to give each localization project their own localized forum and blog
<br />[17:26] <photomatt> and generate pre-localized downloads
<br />[17:27] <photomatt> but other than that, it's groovy :)
<br />[17:27] <MenZa> It is, actually.
<br />[17:27] <MenZa> ..dutch seems like lazy English to me.
<br />[17:27] <MenZa> "Wat is WordPress?"
<br />[17:28] <MenZa> Change all occurrences of "s" to "z" - and there you go, CS speak.
<br />[17:28] <MenZa> ;)
<br />[17:28] <photomatt> heh
<br />[17:29] <photomatt> moving on
<br />[17:29] <undersigned> hello :)
<br />[17:29] <photomatt> Podz has a little bit of good news
<br />[17:29] <MenZa> Oh?
<br />[17:29] <Podz> I do?
<br />[17:29] * MenZa leans back and sips coke
<br />[17:29] <photomatt> Podz: if you want
<br />[17:30] <stevecooley> Hey, Undersigned!
<br />[17:30] <stevecooley> How's it going?
<br />[17:30] <Podz> Oh...Matt has asked me to join automattic and answer a few questions here and there .... so I said yes.
<br />[17:30] <mikelittle> That's great!
<br />[17:30] <stevecooley> sweet!
<br />[17:30] <undersigned> neat Podz
<br />[17:30] <PotterSys> great!
<br />[17:31] <Podz> but I'm still doing all the forum stuff - I'm not leaving there at all.
<br />[17:31] <undersigned> congrats :)
<br />[17:31] <Podz> thanks :)
<br />[17:32] <photomatt> :)
<br />[17:32] <tunicwriter> Podz: I think we would all cry in a corner if you left the forums :)
<br />[17:32] <Podz> LOL
<br />[17:33] <photomatt> bringing some of the support maven magic to the .com users
<br />[17:34] <photomatt> there was some akismet downtime this morning
<br />[17:34] <MenZa> Congrats Podz
<br />[17:34] <photomatt> so if any of you got spam, that's why
<br />[17:34] <undersigned> ah thats why :)
<br />[17:34] <mikelittle> I noticed. 117 spam in moderation!
<br />[17:34] <MenZa> :O
<br />[17:34] <photomatt> mikelittle: whoa, you must get a lot
<br />[17:34] <MenZa> I barely get any. Usually, it's /manual/ spam.
<br />[17:34] <photomatt> I don't even want to think about poor mark ghosh
<br />[17:34] <mikelittle> Yeah, about 500 - 800 a day.
<br />[17:34] <MenZa> mikelittle: holy...
<br />[17:34] <photomatt> according to akismet, he's the most spammed man in the world
<br />[17:35] <MenZa> photomatt: well, how much DOES he get then?
<br />[17:35] <mikelittle> Some days < 100
<br />[17:35] <photomatt> he has received over 300k in the past 4 months or so
<br />[17:35] <MenZa> Holy mother of Cake
<br />[17:35] * MenZa runs off
<br />[17:36] <MenZa> That's gotta tear his bandwidth apart.
<br />[17:36] <photomatt> good question, I don't know
<br />[17:36] <io_error> Akismet Spam (107)
<br />[17:36] <io_error> Holy carp!
<br />[17:36] <photomatt> I got his permission to write a blog about it, but haven't gotten around to it yet
<br />[17:36] * MenZa hugs his disabled WordPress
<br />[17:37] <mumbles> yeh
<br />[17:37] * io_error leaves you all and goes back to coding, these rat bastards must DIE!
<br />[17:37] <photomatt> I think it's because he worked on some of the early anti-spam stuff
<br />[17:37] <photomatt> maybe that's why they target him
<br />[17:37] <photomatt> I think he also has spam on old entries
<br />[17:37] <photomatt> if you have ANY spam links they hit you 10x harder
<br />[17:38] <EduardoE> Q: When Blecki would be available?
<br />[17:38] <mumbles> ive had askmit installed since wordpress 2 came out and its blocked 506
<br />[17:38] * Joins: rboren
<br />[17:38] <io_error> photomatt: they also search for "spam" so if you ever MENTION spam on your blog, they hit you harder
<br />[17:39] <photomatt> surprisingly, the akismet blog gets very little
<br />[17:39] <MenZa> io_error: make a replace script that replaces "spam" with a javascript echo :D
<br />[17:39] <io_error> photomatt: It hasn't been around long enough :)
<br />[17:39] <photomatt> probably true
<br />[17:39] <EduardoE> I need a response, because I'am working with PotterSys in a translation of the Codex to Spanish (international-informal).
<br />[17:39] <photomatt> anyway we're going to be significantly increasing the akismet infrastructure soon
<br />[17:40] <MenZa> They haven't crawled my, currently, disabled fresh install.
<br />[17:40] <photomatt> EduardoE: what do you need?
<br />[17:40] <undersigned> MenZa: more links around the internet increases the spam bot crawler amount on your site :)
<br />[17:40] <EduardoE> A probable date
<br />[17:40] <MenZa> undersigned: Yup.
<br />[17:40] <MenZa> undersigned: your test-thingy said 5 blogs were linking to me :o
<br />[17:41] <photomatt> EduardoE: what do you need a probably date for?
<br />[17:41] <MenZa> photomatt: deadline?
<br />[17:41] <skeltoac> I think he meant Blicki
<br />[17:41] <undersigned> MenZa: yea, yahoo says 116 and google 176
<br />[17:42] <MenZa> undersigned: nifty - good work.
<br />[17:42] <EduardoE> A probably deadline for Blecki
<br />[17:42] <io_error> I need a way to deliver a lethal electrical shock to spammers through their computers. Any ideas?
<br />[17:42] <photomatt> EduardoE: oh, that's a good question
<br />[17:42] <mumbles> hook up there rx to a powersorce
<br />[17:42] <stevecooley> ask William Gibson abot that one
<br />[17:42] <photomatt> blicki is fully scaffolding-complete
<br />[17:43] <MenZa> io_error: <?php shock('100351v', '1000a'); ?>
<br />[17:43] <photomatt> however the UI doesn't really match what people expect in a wiki
<br />[17:43] <photomatt> whether that's the hard part or not, is arguable
<br />[17:43] <MenZa> photomatt: I like it. MediaWiki blending with WP.org? Very nice.
<br />[17:44] <photomatt> it's basically pages + versioning
<br />[17:44] * MenZa shrugs
<br />[17:47] <photomatt> so I don't know a good date for that
<br />[17:47] <photomatt> EduardoE: best bet is go with mediawiki for now,or hack on blicki
<br />[17:47] <photomatt> we will have a mediawiki import at some point though
<br />[17:47] <EduardoE> Ok.
<br />[17:48] <photomatt> EduardoE: would you guys be doing a wordpress.org site port like http://nl.wordpress.net?
<br />[17:49] <EduardoE> Only a translation of the contents of the Codex for now.
<br />[17:49] <MenZa> photomatt: I'm currently translating the Firemonger (Firefox, Thunderbird) CD to Danish, but if a Danish translation is - at some point - urgent, don't hesitate to contact me.
<br />[17:50] <photomatt> okay
<br />[17:51] <photomatt> any other topics?
<br />[17:51] <MenZa> Actually
<br />[17:51] <photomatt> yes?
<br />[17:51] <undersigned> MenZa: we could cooperate on it if necessary
<br />[17:52] <MenZa> undersigned: sweet :)
<br />[17:52] <MenZa> photomatt: someone in #wp suggested an IRC client be added to the dash, for fast support -- would this be possible -- and necessary?
<br />[17:53] <photomatt> whoa, that would be pretty hardcore
<br />[17:53] <photomatt> I don't think IRC is a scalable support mechanism for that many people
<br />[17:54] <stevecooley> sounds like a great plugin candidate :)
<br />[17:54] <undersigned> would be some sort of java client or cgi::irc or something..
<br />[17:54] <photomatt> chat really strains when supporting more than one topic at a time</a>
<br />[17:54] <MenZa> photomatt: #wp-support ?
<br />[17:54] <MenZa> :o
<br />[17:54] <undersigned> and the java clients has serious problems on mac ive observed
<br />[17:54] <photomatt> if there were new people coming into a chat channel
<br />[17:54] <photomatt> they really would need a private channel per issue
<br />[17:54] <photomatt> and then you've basically recreated forums on IRC, but with no search/etc
<br />[17:55] <undersigned> photomatt: almost would be better with some sort of helpdesk solution then.. but that would require a supporter for each joiner
<br />[17:55] <stevecooley> which would be fine if you had a pay-for-support system in place.. right? all things are doable for the right amount of money
<br />[17:55] <stevecooley> otherwise, all the info is probably in the support forums or codex
<br />[17:55] <photomatt> I suppose so, but then it's definitely the realm of a plugin
<br />[17:56] <stevecooley> if not, then those are really the right place to get help anyway
<br />[17:56] <undersigned> forums are a better solution i think as well.. at least people tend to respond quickly there as well
<br />[17:56] <photomatt> the forums can be very chat like, they're so active :)
<br />[17:56] <undersigned> yea, some times its going really fast
<br />[17:57] <MenZa> photomatt: you ain't seen nothing yet ;)
<br />[17:57] <Podz> and even faster support discourages seeking solutions
<br />[17:57] <stevecooley> agreed
<br />[17:57] <photomatt> good point
<br />[17:57] <undersigned> yea
<br />[17:57] <MenZa> aye
<br />[17:58] <undersigned> nicotine
<br />[17:58] <Podz> that's why in the forums we wait at least 60 seconds :)
<br />[17:58] <undersigned> Podz: haha
<br />[17:58] <stevecooley> part of a system that costs no money is the added benefit of making you get up on problem solving stuff for yourself :)
<br />[17:58] <photomatt> if there are no other topics, we can close out talking about the automattic funding I blogged about earlier, if you guys have any questions
<br />[17:59] <undersigned> im off, gnight
<br />[18:00] <stevecooley> photomatt, can you send the URL for that post?
<br />[18:01] <photomatt> sure, http://photomatt.net/2006/04/12/a-little-funding/
<br />[18:01] <stevecooley> thank you sir
<br />[18:01] * stevecooley goes to read
<br />[18:02] <stevecooley> ok question
<br />[18:02] <MenZa> Goodnight everyone.
<br />[18:02] <stevecooley> Where do I sign up to invest? :)
<br />[18:03] <mumbles> i would invest but ive only got 88 pence left in my bank
<br />[18:03] <photomatt> thanks guys :)
<br />[18:04] <undersigned> ive got a few dollars too
<br />[18:04] * MenZa sticks hands into pockets
<br />[18:04] * PotterSys adds "Give love to Automattic" in his when-mom-gets-the-Visa list
<br />[18:04] <MenZa> lol
<br />[18:05] <MenZa> I have a Visa Electron -- good card. Well, when your bank-account isn't empty
<br />[18:05] <MenZa> I'm off.
<br />[18:05] <PotterSys> MenZa: indeed
<br />[18:05] <MenZa> Goodnight -- photomatt, PotterSys, mumbles, undersigned, stevecooley.
<br />[18:05] <mumbles> MenZa yeh
<br />[18:05] * tunicwriter adds "Give love to Automattic" in his when-steals-Pottersys'-identity-after-PotterSys'-mom-gets-the-Visa list
<br />[18:05] * Quits: MenZa ("Lost terminal"ï¿½)
<br />[18:05] <stevecooley> night, MenZa
<br />[18:05] <stevecooley> doh
<br />[18:05] <PotterSys> tunicwriter: lol
<br />[18:06] <mumbles> photomatt - when the fuss has died down about the securtor depot getting robbed ill post you a soitcase of money
<br />[18:07] <photomatt> thank you very much for the support guys, it's heart-warming :)
<br />[18:07] <photomatt> if you have any questions or concerns, just ping me
<br />[18:08] <mumbles> photomatt dose askmit have its own # ?
<br />[18:08] * Quits: EduardoE ("Leaving"ï¿½)
<br />[18:08] <photomatt> own # how?
<br />[18:09] <mumbles> like #askmit ?
<br />[18:09] <photomatt> oh, no it doesn't
<br />[18:13] <undersigned> photomatt: regarding my theme site.. i cant really use hosting anywhere else cause i run a snapshot service - server side.. using webkit
<br />[18:13] <undersigned> unless it is mac hosting of course..
<br />[18:14] <undersigned> and if donations starts to pay my hosting costs ill remove the ads
<br />[18:14] <photomatt> gotcha
<br />[18:15] <undersigned> started the site to compete - i believe competition helps the community grow stronger
<br />[18:15] <undersigned> just to be clear ...
<br />[18:18] <photomatt> alrigty
<br />[18:19] <photomatt> unless there are any other topics, we can close this one up
<br />[18:20] <PotterSys> i think that's all, unless someone is having serious problems with IRC...
<br />[18:22] <photomatt> </meetup>

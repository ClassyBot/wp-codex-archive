<p>[21:11] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; well, in the interest of people who are up extra late today, shall we get started?
<br />[21:11] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; &lt;meetup&gt;
<br />[21:12] &lt;PotterSys&gt; first topic: 2.0 relase
<br />[21:12] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; actually it's probably out of order
<br />[21:12] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; let's start with the top support issues since 2.0 went live on the site
<br />[21:12] &lt;Podz&gt; well the 404's have gone at long last
<br />[21:13] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; not quite, they're still there
<br />[21:13] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; just not on the forums
<br />[21:13] &lt;Podz&gt; true
<br />[21:14] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; however - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.litespeedtech.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1580#1580">http://www.litespeedtech.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1580#1580</a>
<br />[21:14] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; I expect the problem to be totally gone within 24 hours
<br />[21:15] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; Podz: what have you noticed as the most frequent topics in the forums?
<br />[21:15] &lt;Podz&gt; uploads, rewrite rules, the RTE
<br />[21:15] &lt;masquerade&gt; I'll mention that the new uploading is by far, the longest topic related to 2.0 that's out there
<br />[21:16] &lt;Podz&gt; most people dislike the lack of control. I know I would.
<br />[21:16] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; what about the rewrite rules have been an issue?
<br />[21:17] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; a thread pointer is fine
<br />[21:17] &lt;Podz&gt; there have been some bugs i think but otherwise it's 'where did they go&#160;?' type stuff
<br />[21:17] * Joins: io_error
<br />[21:18] &lt;masquerade&gt; 3370-3372 is also a good indicator
<br />[21:19] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; gotcha
<br />[21:20] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; has the upload complaints been mostly about the interface, the folder structure, or something else?
<br />[21:21] &lt;masquerade&gt; I've seen a lot of posts about the uploader interface, people don't seem to realize you can click to get a menu
<br />[21:22] &lt;masquerade&gt; and, I've seen a few posts about security violations while upgrading, as well as one person in IRC, apparently he couldn't even upload .jpg files
<br />[21:23] &lt;Podz&gt; photomatt - safe mode has come up a few times. I commented on this before release and i've read that a fix has just been committed. be nice for that to have been in the release itself..
<br />[21:23] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; the menu isn't where I'd like it yet, but I think we could perhaps address some of the confusion with documentation for now
<br />[21:23] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; Podz: safe mode how?
<br />[21:25] &lt;PotterSys&gt; photomatt_sfo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/User:PotterSys/Media_Managment">http://codex.wordpress.org/User:PotterSys/Media_Managment</a>
<br />[21:25] &lt;Podz&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic.php?id=53381&amp;replies=5">http://wordpress.org/support/topic.php?id=53381&amp;replies=5</a>
<br />[21:25] &lt;Podz&gt; that sort of thing
<br />[21:26] &lt;Podz&gt;  (merging tags = much errors!)
<br />[21:27] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; much errors?
<br />[21:27] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; it's irreversible, so be careful
<br />[21:27] &lt;Podz&gt; near 'WHERE tag_id = '50<i> at line 1]</i>
<br />[21:27] &lt;Podz&gt; UPDATE minibb_tags SET tag_count = WHERE tag_id = '50'
<br />[21:28] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; hmm
<br />[21:28] &lt;Podz&gt; anway - thats another issue&#160;:)
<br />[21:30] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; traffic on the forums has been lower than I expected
<br />[21:30] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; just by the numbers, it's about average (120ish posts a day)
<br />[21:30] &lt;Podz&gt; possibly because they came, saw breakage and left&#160;?
<br />[21:31] &lt;Podz&gt; I know I've had a leap in personal email
<br />[21:32] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; maybe?
<br />[21:32] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; It should jump after the dev blog post, which I don't want to do until we're certain server issues have been straightened out
<br />[21:33] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; already we did a quarter of a million pageviews yesterday
<br />[21:33] &lt;Podz&gt; will yahoo let codex be up&#160;? They aren't doing much of a job these days
<br />[21:34] &lt;io_error&gt; Podz: You ask too much of Yeehaw!
<br />[21:35] &lt;Podz&gt; I'll admit that if codex equates to how they'll look after wp users ... not good.
<br />[21:35] &lt;Podz&gt; and their 'auto update' is very worrying indeed.
<br />[21:37] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; I'll send them a note about the codex seeing if anything is up, I haven't noticed any problems myself, though it does seem slower than normal
<br />[21:38] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; the auto-update is fantastic, I've tested it several times
<br />[21:38] &lt;Podz&gt; we'll have to take your word for it&#160;:)
<br />[21:39] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; well they'll be doing one in a few weeks
<br />[21:39] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; so we'll see
<br />[21:40] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; wrt "Server issues"
<br />[21:40] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; unfortunately there will need to be another server jump for wp.org
<br />[21:40] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; on the plus side, it's in the same datacenter (less downtime)
<br />[21:40] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; and it's identical code
<br />[21:41] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; also the bad DNS server that caused the bouncing last time has been tamed
<br />[21:41] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; hopefully it'll be tonight, but I'll send a note out to the list when it happens
<br />[21:41] &lt;Podz&gt; I'll be asleep&#160;:)
<br />[21:42] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; whew!
<br />[21:42] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; there goes half of the forum traffic&#160;;)
<br />[21:42] &lt;mikelittle&gt; I still get 404's regularly (on the counter page and screen shots just now)
<br />[21:42] &lt;Podz&gt; I'm retiring at 10,000 posts&#160;:)
<br />[21:43] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; new, flexible with codex is live
<br />[21:43] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; mikelittle: yes they're still liable on any page that uses mod_rewrite
<br />[21:43] &lt;mikelittle&gt; OK *nods*
<br />[21:43] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; I haven't upgraded the web server yet with the fix I linked above
<br />[21:43] &lt;masquerade&gt; photomatt_sfo, and sufficiently ugly in Firefox, it overlaps
<br />[21:44] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; reload
<br />[21:44] &lt;masquerade&gt; there it goes
<br />[21:44] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; next step is cleaning up a lot of that ugly inline CSS embedded everywhere
<br />[21:44] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; and moving it to classes and stylesheets
<br />[21:44] &lt;masquerade&gt; except on pages where there's a Table of Contents
<br />[21:44] &lt;masquerade&gt; there's still overlaps
<br />[21:45] &lt;masquerade&gt; s/overlaps/overlap
<br />[21:45] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Features">http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Features</a> you see an overlap?
<br />[21:45] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; or is a specefic page
<br />[21:46] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; Podz: I think you already crossed 10k
<br />[21:46] &lt;Podz&gt; photomatt - no idea&#160;:)
<br />[21:46] &lt;masquerade&gt; mmm, and the codex won't load now
<br />[21:46] &lt;masquerade&gt; and it suddenly snaps back
<br />[21:47] &lt;masquerade&gt; photomatt, I see an overlap there as well, any page with a TOC is overlapping with the Views column
<br />[21:47] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; hmm
<br />[21:48] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; I'm on FF here too
<br />[21:48] &lt;alphaoide&gt; it overlaps when the browser is wider than 1280
<br />[21:48] &lt;Podz&gt; I have a 10px? scroll
<br />[21:49] &lt;Podz&gt; 1024/768
<br />[21:51] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; alphaoide: thanks!
<br />[21:51] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; I probably mixed up some percentages and set margines
<br />[21:51] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; *margins
<br />[21:51] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; I'll take a look at it when I'm home, stuck on the laptop for now
<br />[21:51] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; Podz: yes that's the margin problem
<br />[21:52] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; is the flex design better in general though?
<br />[21:53] &lt;Podz&gt; I think info sites need width not height. So I'd vote for wider myself.
<br />[21:56] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; k
<br />[21:57] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; so about the announcement, I'm going to upload a draft to my user page later
<br />[21:57] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; assuming server things go well, it can "go out" tomorrow
<br />[21:57] &lt;Podz&gt; Please can we have a proper way for wp.com people to get info/support/things answered&#160;?
<br />[21:58] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; yes
<br />[21:58] &lt;Podz&gt; matt - is 1.5.2 secure&#160;?
<br />[21:59] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; Podz: I've been talking with Ryan about doing a 1.5.3 release with some updates, including security
<br />[21:59] &lt;Podz&gt; is that  a definite&#160;? many people are not moving to 2.0 and to leave 1.5.2 unsecured would be bad for wp
<br />[22:01] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; there is nothing in 1.5.2 I would say is a threat to people waiting on it for a bit
<br />[22:01] &lt;Podz&gt; 'for a bit'&#160;?
<br />[22:02] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; I don't remember the exact issue, but it was fairly esoteric and the person needed to be above level 6 or 7
<br />[22:02] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; if people are using blogs with multiple authors, I would highly recommend they update to 2.0 for things like the KSES integration with posting and such
<br />[22:03] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; that's not something that would be backported
<br />[22:04] &lt;Podz&gt; but 1.5.2 for a single user  IS secure&#160;? We will be asked this after release so a definitive would be good to use in the forums
<br />[22:06] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; yes, afaik
<br />[22:06] &lt;Podz&gt; thanks&#160;:)
<br />[22:07] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; unless there are any questions, we should wrap up
<br />[22:08] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; I'll fix the codex width issue and upgrade the web server when I get home
<br />[22:08] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; (the first time I'll be home since Dec 2)
<br />[22:08] &lt;Podz&gt; I'm done with q's
<br />[22:09] &lt;mikelittle&gt; OK by me. My bed calls...
<br />[22:12] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; g'night folks
<br />[22:12] &lt;photomatt_sfo&gt; &lt;/meetup&gt;

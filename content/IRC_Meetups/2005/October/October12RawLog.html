<p>[18:02] &lt;io_error&gt; We were supposed to propose a topic?
<br />[18:03] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; go for it
<br />[18:03] &lt;io_error&gt; Hm, more hooks for 1.6?
<br />[18:03] &lt;Podz&gt; there's nothing really from the forums. Two suggestions I did make to the list though:
<br />[18:03] &lt;Podz&gt; - a 'backticks' button&#160;?
<br />[18:03] &lt;io_error&gt; zedrdave would like a hook that's called when a plugin is activated.
<br />[18:03] &lt;Podz&gt; - and search really does need looking at
<br />[18:03] * io_error agrees
<br />[18:04] &lt;PotterSys&gt; sorry for ask this now, but how much did I lost?
<br />[18:04] &lt;io_error&gt; PotterSys: nothing
<br />[18:04] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; okay
<br />[18:04] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; i'm trying to avoid typing much
<br />[18:04] &lt;PotterSys&gt; io_error: thanks&#160;:)
<br />[18:05] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; hooks should go in trac, they're almost always approved
<br />[18:06] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; Podz, could you expand?
<br />[18:06] &lt;io_error&gt; error_bot: newticket
<br />[18:06] &lt;error_bot&gt; io_error: TracBot does not have a tracBase defined for this channel
<br />[18:06] &lt;io_error&gt; errr
<br />[18:06] &lt;Podz&gt; a backticks or [code] type button that really does display true code. We get some weird breakages
<br />[18:07] &lt;Podz&gt; it can take several posts just to get it right from people which slows their help and annoys them
<br />[18:07] &lt;Podz&gt; some tags also will break the ` currently if they aren't correct
<br />[18:08] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; hmm
<br />[18:08] &lt;Podz&gt; so a nifty button would be nice&#160;:)
<br />[18:08] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; can we encourage code to go someplace else?
<br />[18:08] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; the forums don't really fit large codes
<br />[18:08] &lt;Podz&gt; but code in the forums is in come way a resource
<br />[18:08] &lt;Podz&gt; come=some
<br />[18:10] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; k
<br />[18:10] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; added to bbpress todo
<br />[18:10] &lt;Podz&gt; no biggie, but it would be a nice addition if it came along
<br />[18:10] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; agreed
<br />[18:12] &lt;io_error&gt; error_bot: ticket 1752
<br />[18:12] &lt;error_bot&gt; io_error: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1752">http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1752</a>
<br />[18:12] &lt;io_error&gt; thank you
<br />[18:13] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; cool
<br />[18:14] &lt;io_error&gt; I knew that bot would be useful someday.
<br />[18:14] &lt;skeltoac&gt; io_error: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://trac.wordpress.org/file/trunk/wp-admin/plugins.php">http://trac.wordpress.org/file/trunk/wp-admin/plugins.php</a> has it already
<br />[18:15] &lt;io_error&gt; skeltoac: oh, nice, it's activate_ plus the plugin name
<br />[18:15] &lt;io_error&gt; sweet
<br />[18:15] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt;&#160;:)
<br />[18:16] &lt;io_error&gt; is it the plugin name, or the plugin filename?
<br />[18:16] &lt;skeltoac&gt; I think it's the filename
<br />[18:17] &lt;io_error&gt; that should work.
<br />[18:17] &lt;io_error&gt; when was that added?
<br />[18:18] &lt;skeltoac&gt; 10/5 I guess
<br />[18:18] &lt;io_error&gt; hm, okay
<br />[18:18] &lt;skeltoac&gt; I think there's a fatal error in there somewhere. I remember submitting a patch but it doesn't look like it's been committed. I'll check with rboren.
<br />[18:20] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; sounds good
<br />[18:20] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; any other topics to cover?
<br />[18:20] &lt;io_error&gt; I have one more question: just how stable is 1.6 right now?
<br />[18:21] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; i should be able to type better next week so we can cover more
<br />[18:21] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; io_error: 85%
<br />[18:21] &lt;io_error&gt; hm, okay, I'll start playing with a test blog, I think
<br />[18:21] * io_error runs out of topics
<br />[18:22] &lt;skeltoac&gt; Has anyone else been hammered by friends and family for a spell checker?
<br />[18:23] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; yes
<br />[18:23] &lt;geeksmakemehot&gt; I'd love a good spell checker&#160;:)
<br />[18:23] &lt;skeltoac&gt; Well, one friend and one family member, but they're persistent&#160;:)
<br />[18:23] &lt;geeksmakemehot&gt; I can't sepell vry gud
<br />[18:24] &lt;skeltoac&gt; I think TinyMCE has something but I wonder if it's worth making available in WP.
<br />[18:25] &lt;io_error&gt; I can spell, but my keyboard conspires against me.
<br />[18:25] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; the usually require pspell
<br />[18:26] &lt;io_error&gt; PHP has support for aspell and pspell, it seems
<br />[18:27] &lt;skeltoac&gt; IIRC, TinyMCE has a dictionary checker that's entirely JS. It would be heavy, so it should probably not be included by default.
<br />[18:27] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; firas was working on spelling I think
<br />[18:28] &lt;io_error&gt; photomatt_wrk: yeah, he was, and his demo bot is offline
<br />[18:28] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; maybe ask on wp-hackers?
<br />[18:30] * Joins: stevecooley
<br />[18:31] &lt;io_error&gt; OK, so it's agreed, people who are late to meetups should be forced to use movable type for a week&#160;;)
<br />[18:31] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; heh
<br />[18:31] &lt;Podz&gt; a week&#160;? no time to blog then&#160;:)
<br />[18:31] &lt;geeksmakemehot&gt; Naw, just forced to install it&#160;:)
<br />[18:31] &lt;masquerade&gt; io_error, I thought the general consensus was two, oh, hey stevecooley
<br />[18:31] &lt;io_error&gt; it takes a week to install it
<br />[18:32] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; you guys&#160;;)
<br />[18:32] &lt;stevecooley&gt; lol
<br />[18:32] &lt;stevecooley&gt; *I* was here last week
<br />[18:32] &lt;skeltoac&gt; ouch
<br />[18:32] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; let's cut it short today, next week we can do a full one
<br />[18:32] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; stevecooley: sorry was at web 2.0
<br />[18:32] &lt;io_error&gt; stevecooley: you missed the whoel thing!
<br />[18:33] &lt;stevecooley&gt; I'm flattered you're waiting for _ME_ to start the meeting!
<br />[18:33] &lt;stevecooley&gt; gosh!
<br />[18:33] &lt;stevecooley&gt;&#160;;)
<br />[18:33] &lt;io_error&gt; stevecooley: oh, no, we didn't wait for you&#160;;)
<br />[18:34] &lt;stevecooley&gt; io_error: well that's good&#160;:)
<br />[18:36] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; &lt;/meetup&gt;
<br />[18:36] &lt;io_error&gt; see you all next week, same time, same channel

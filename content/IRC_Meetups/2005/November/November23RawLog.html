<br />[5:01 PM] &lt;stevecooley&gt; I almost forgot&#160;:)
<br />[5:01 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; me too
<br />[5:01 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; podz only told me 20 mins ago&#160;:)
<br />[5:01 PM] &lt;gsnedders&gt; heh. I got in 15 min ago
<br />[5:02 PM] &lt;gsnedders&gt; iCal alarm went off&#160;:P
<br />[5:02 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; I just pulled over
<br />[5:02 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; to find a starbucks
<br />[5:02 PM] &lt;rboren_lappy&gt; I'm at Deaf Dog.
<br />[5:02 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; I don't drink coffee, but their wifi is good
<br />[5:02 PM] &lt;gsnedders&gt;&#160;:)
<br />[5:03 PM] &lt;stevecooley&gt; Hey, I think I read SF is getting free wifi
<br />[5:03 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; okay, the codex is loading for me
<br />[5:03 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; as it's the day before thanksgiving, I don't expect too much today
<br />[5:03 PM] &lt;gsnedders&gt; ...not in the UK...
<br />[5:03 PM] &lt;Podz&gt; yup
<br />[5:04 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; ah true
<br />[5:04 PM] &lt;Podz&gt; we give thanks /every day/&#160;:p
<br />[5:04 PM] &lt;gsnedders&gt; and David, who posted the only thing, is in the UK
<br />[5:04 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; haha
<br />[5:04 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; so the question is how to make getting a WP.com account easier
<br />[5:04 PM] &lt;gsnedders&gt;&#160;:)
<br />[5:04 PM] --&gt;| TonySt (n=Tony@unaffiliated/wptony) has joined #wordpress-meetup
<br />[5:04 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; I think that may have been posted before we opened up registrations?
<br />[5:04 PM] &lt;gsnedders&gt; yeah
<br />[5:04 PM] &lt;gsnedders&gt; 19th
<br />[5:05 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; well, done!
<br />[5:05 PM] &lt;gsnedders&gt;&#160;:)
<br />[5:05 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; it's as easy as it's ever going to be

<br />[5:05 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; let's talk about 2.0, how are we doing bugwise?
<br />[5:05 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; as a complete noob to this, i was slightly confused on how to get an API key for akismet
<br />[5:06 PM] &lt;gsnedders&gt; photomatt_lap: try scrapping the form, make it easier&#160;:)
<br />[5:06 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; i have a wp powered blog so i didn't understand why i had to sign up with wordpress.com to get one
<br />[5:06 PM] --&gt;| mumbles (n=mumbles@cpc2-bror1-6-0-cust74.bmly.cable.ntl.com) has joined #wordpress-meetup
<br />[5:06 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; anthonymcg: I'm making some changes to both sites to make that clearer
<br />[5:06 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; right
<br />[5:06 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; lo even
<br />[5:07 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; thanks, i'm a user since b2 but it was still slightly mystifying
<br />[5:07 PM] &lt;shep&gt; image upload in 2.0 needs a lot of work
<br />[5:07 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; we have 24 active tickets

<br />[5:08 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; havent got round to testing 2.0 yet
<br />[5:08 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; installed will work on it tommow
<br />[5:09 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; I think it's coming along fairly nicely
<br />[5:10 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; there are some bugs I want to tackle the next day or two in a turkey-induced haze, then I think it would warrant a beta-3 that's more widely announced
<br />[5:10 PM] --&gt;| davidhouse (n=david@host86-132-143-1.range86-132.btcentralplus.com) has joined #wordpress-meetup
<br />[5:11 PM] &lt;davidhouse&gt; have i missed the meetup?
<br />[5:11 PM] &lt;shep&gt; no
<br />[5:11 PM] &lt;Podz&gt; photomatt - you seem to have a target date&#160;?
<br />[5:11 PM] &lt;shep&gt; but the meetup missed you
<br />[5:11 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; davidhouse: mostly&#160;;)
<br />[5:11 PM] &lt;davidhouse&gt; ah well.
<br />[5:11 PM] &lt;davidhouse&gt;&#160;:)
<br />[5:11 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; Podz: when it's ready!&#160;;)
<br />[5:12 PM] &lt;Podz&gt; hmm ...... seems to be being rushed a wee bit that's all
<br />[5:12 PM] &lt;shep&gt; photomatt_lap: when is the new wp.org site going up?
<br />[5:12 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; it is moving quicker than before, but we also have more people devoting more time than any previous release
<br />[5:13 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; I think this will be the best-tested one yet
<br />[5:13 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; shep: soonish, maybe with launch
<br />[5:13 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; will the media handling be fully ready for 2.0, yes?
<br />[5:13 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; I can show you guys a URL I've been playing around with, not for sharing
<br />[5:13 PM] &lt;shep&gt;&#160;:)
<br />[5:13 PM] &lt;Podz&gt; matt - this is logged&#160;:)
<br />[5:13 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; whoever has the access can edit&#160;?
<br />[5:14 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; it's not THAT big a deal, but very unfinished - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://new.wordpress.org/">http://new.wordpress.org/</a>
<br />[5:14 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; layout errors, PHP errors, and blank pages everywhere
<br />[5:14 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; looking nice 
<br />[5:14 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; just starting to truck through it page-by-page
<br />[5:15 PM] &lt;davidhouse&gt; nice&#160;:)
<br />[5:15 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; nice look alright
<br />[5:15 PM] &lt;TonySt&gt; very nice
<br />[5:15 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; "state-of-the-art semantic personal publishing platform" - thats a mouthfull&#160;:)
<br />[5:15 PM] &lt;gsnedders&gt; i'm not sure about the wordpress announcements at the bottom, almost looks out of place
<br />[5:16 PM] &lt;michel_v&gt; matt: small alignment issue: I think the sidebar's top border should be aligned with the top of the content's letters
<br />[5:16 PM] &lt;mikelittle&gt; The about page seems really light on the left. Maybe put the right content there?
<br />[5:16 PM] &lt;michel_v&gt; that's the top of WordPress is a state of the art's W
<br />[5:16 PM] &lt;TonySt&gt; I'm glad 'Code Is Poetry' survived&#160;:-)
<br />[5:16 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; mikelittle: yep the menus aren't there yet, there will be navigation there
<br />[5:16 PM] &lt;davidhouse&gt; the wordpress announcements bit can get mixed up with the left sidebar when the page is very short
<br />[5:17 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; the layout hasn't been tested in any browser yet, just trying to get the framework there first
<br />[5:17 PM] &lt;davidhouse&gt; sure,
<br />[5:17 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; the markup is changing a bit, trying to make it lighter and cleaner
<br />[5:17 PM] &lt;mikelittle&gt; Nice 404
<br />[5:17 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; though it was pretty minimal before, most WP.org pages are only a few k
<br />[5:18 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; so stay tuned, it should be more polished by next week
<br />[5:18 PM] &lt;mikelittle&gt; Cool! Looks good.
<br />[5:19 PM] * davidhouse is looking forward to the codex integration
<br />[5:19 PM] &lt;michel_v&gt; I'm not a big fan of orphan links using bold georgia, but overall it's very nice
<br />[5:20 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; squashing bugs is a bigger priority right now though, I think we can get 2.0 ready for release in early December
<br />[5:20 PM] &lt;davidhouse&gt; just in time for christmas.
<br />[5:21 PM] &lt;davidhouse&gt; the perfect present&#160;:)
<br />[5:21 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; "give WP 2.0 for festivus"
<br />[5:21 PM] &lt;davidhouse&gt; have we got a jazz player to name it after?
<br />[5:21 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; not yet
<br />[5:22 PM] &lt;shep&gt; christian mcbride!
<br />[5:22 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; past that, there is a lot to clean up and optimize in the codebase for point releases
<br />[5:22 PM] &lt;shep&gt; charlie hunter!
<br />[5:22 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; but who knows, there may never be a 3.0. we're already addressing the vast majority of the needs of people out there
<br />[5:22 PM] &lt;davidhouse&gt; you mean we might actually... finish... some software?
<br />[5:22 PM] |&lt;-- rboren_lappy has left irc.freenode.net (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
<br />[5:23 PM] &lt;davidhouse&gt;&#160;:)
<br />[5:23 PM] * TonySt wonders what happened to 1.7, 1.8, 1.9&#160;;-)
<br />[5:23 PM] &lt;davidhouse&gt; blogging will evolve. wordpress with it.
<br />[5:23 PM] &lt;gsnedders&gt; the thing is, making it too bloated would take away users... Including myself...
<br />[5:23 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; I'd rather do one thing really well in WP than adding a ton of functionality only some people use
<br />[5:23 PM] &lt;gsnedders&gt; I'm sure I'm not the only one who would move away
<br />[5:24 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; I could see related projects though that work well with WP
<br />[5:24 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; like bbpress will be someday&#160;:)
<br />[5:24 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; Whats the one thing matt?&#160;:)
<br />[5:25 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; making it effortless for people write and communicate
<br />[5:25 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt;&#160;:)
<br />[5:26 PM] &lt;Podz&gt; 'effortless'  ... that'll be ThoughtPress then&#160;:)
<br />[5:26 PM] &lt;davidhouse&gt;&#160;:)
<br />[5:26 PM] &lt;Podz&gt; def need some delete buttons there!
<br />[5:26 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; ha!
<br />[5:26 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; "blogging your thoughts instantly"
<br />[5:26 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; someday

<br />[5:27 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; it's still flexible at this point
<br />[5:27 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; u going on to les blogs?
<br />[5:27 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; yes

<br />[5:28 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; of july&#160;?
<br />[5:28 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; of december
<br />[5:28 PM] &lt;gsnedders&gt; WorldTour London? what?
<br />[5:28 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; ah 
<br />[5:28 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; london before paris or vice versa?
<br />[5:28 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; crap on a workday 
<br />[5:28 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt;&#160;:)
<br />[5:29 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; on the 7th I could fly to london and finish out the week there. do any of those evenings work well for a WP meetup?
<br />[5:29 PM] &lt;gsnedders&gt; on a schoolday..
<br />[5:29 PM] &lt;gsnedders&gt; in scotland&#160;:P
<br />[5:29 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; any good venues londoners could suggest?
<br />[5:29 PM] &lt;davidhouse&gt; right. i'm out&#160;:) enjoy the rest of meetup.
<br />[5:29 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; it could be that weekend

<br />[5:29 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; could make any eaviningt
<br />[5:30 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; Podz, mikelittle: any thoughts?
<br />[5:30 PM] &lt;mikelittle&gt; I would def try to get there weekend would be ideal, else I would have to take a day off work.
<br />[5:30 PM] &lt;mikelittle&gt; I don't know london at all to suggest venues.
<br />[5:30 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; it'd be great to get as many of the WP regulars there as possible
<br />[5:30 PM] &lt;Podz&gt; weekend is bound to be better
<br />[5:31 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; I believe there is already a geek dinner on the 10th
<br />[5:31 PM] &lt;Podz&gt; mikelittle, a few comments here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.tamba2.org.uk/T2/archives/2005/09/28/wordpress-london/#comments">http://www.tamba2.org.uk/T2/archives/2005/09/28/wordpress-london/#comments</a>
<br />[5:31 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; you beat me to that podz, was just about to paste the link
<br />[5:32 PM] &lt;shep&gt; Podz: you pay for my ticket, i'll pay for your dinner&#160;:)
<br />[5:32 PM] &lt;gsnedders&gt; somebody want to try and get me down from scotland?&#160;:P
<br />[5:32 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; maybe a meal around 7ish, then drinks from 9 on
<br />[5:32 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; i'd suggest a sledge
<br />[5:33 PM] =-= TonySt is now known as Tony`
<br />[5:33 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; rememebers to saveup for an eavning out
<br />[5:34 PM] &lt;mikelittle&gt; I'm teetotal, but have no preference for type of venue. Meal, drinks, I'm easy.
<br />[5:34 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; so it'd be friday the 9th or sunday the 11th
<br />[5:34 PM] &lt;Podz&gt; matt - either you choose or we make it a vote from attendees&#160;?
<br />[5:35 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; would perfer it to not be a sunday 
<br />[5:35 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; because i have work 
<br />[5:35 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; sounds like requirements are: venue with space in case people show up, non-alcoholic options, and not too expensive
<br />[5:35 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; me too, work monday in dublin
<br />[5:35 PM] &lt;mikelittle&gt; Either for me, I have some leave time to use up. if its Friday.
<br />[5:35 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; friday would be better
<br />[5:35 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; someone want to lead on venue search so?
<br />[5:35 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; got thersday and friday off work 
<br />[5:36 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; don't really know london venues

<br />[5:37 PM] &lt;Podz&gt; anthonymcg, I'll continue the thread on that entry above, see what arrives
<br />[5:37 PM] &lt;michel_v&gt; "michel_v got me drunk, dancing &amp; blogging again
<br />[5:37 PM] &lt;michel_v&gt; Just another WordPress.com weblog"
<br />[5:38 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; good stuff podz
<br />[5:38 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; Podz:  could be good actaly 
<br />[5:38 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; and lesver squire is close buy as well 
<br />[5:38 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; we'll revert to matt with a consensus by the weekend?
<br />[5:38 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; lester 
<br />[5:39 PM] * stevecooley wonders: What is a blog if it's not posted to?
<br />[5:39 PM] &lt;Podz&gt; b__g
<br />[5:39 PM] &lt;Podz&gt; Friday 9th then&#160;? date set&#160;?
<br />[5:40 PM] &lt;michel_v&gt; stevecooley: a placeholder
<br />[5:40 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; sounds like that date is best
<br />[5:40 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; lapland at the trocadero eh? giggidy
<br />[5:40 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; so let's set that and just try to figure out the venue
<br />[5:40 PM] &lt;Podz&gt; okay&#160;:)
<br />[5:40 PM] &lt;stevecooley&gt; michel_v: fair enough&#160;:)
<br />[5:40 PM] &lt;mikelittle&gt; OK
<br />[5:40 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; drinks + free wireless&#160;?
<br />[5:40 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; which i will defer entirely to our english wordpressers
<br />[5:41 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; wireless isn't a show-stopper, worst comes to worst we can just talk to each other instead of using our laptops&#160;:)
<br />[5:41 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt;&#160;:P would be cool though
<br />[5:41 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; am asking some english geeks i know
<br />[5:41 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; talk? are u nuts?!&#160;:)
<br />[5:41 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; where in london would you be staying&#160;?
<br />[5:42 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; mumbles: no plans yte
<br />[5:42 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; *yet
<br />[5:42 PM] &lt;gsnedders&gt; i don't know of anywhere in London for that kinda meeting&#160;:)
<br />[5:42 PM] &lt;michel_v&gt; photomatt_lap: by the way, you coming to Les Blogs?
<br />[5:43 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; michel_v: indeed
<br />[5:43 PM] &lt;stevecooley&gt; happy thanksgiving, all us americans...  have a nice regular day to the rest of you&#160;:)
<br />[5:43 PM] |&lt;-- stevecooley has left irc.freenode.net ()
<br />[5:44 PM] &lt;michel_v&gt; photomatt_lap: we're planning lunch the day before with suw charman, would you be one of us?
<br />[5:44 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; one last item for the meetup - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pottersys/65965512/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/pottersys/65965512/</a>
<br />[5:44 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; michel_v: sounds fun, I'd love to
<br />[5:44 PM] &lt;michel_v&gt; photomatt_lap: I won't be at Les Blogs itself, I'm too broke&#160;:p
<br />[5:45 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; it's overpriced anyway
<br />[5:45 PM] &lt;shep&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pottersys/65965512/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/pottersys/65965512/</a>
<br />[5:45 PM] &lt;shep&gt; heh
<br />[5:45 PM] &lt;michel_v&gt; I don't know. per american standards, it's standard price
<br />[5:45 PM] &lt;shep&gt; brilliant!
<br />[5:45 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; and there's a notable lack of non-six apart products represented *cough*
<br />[5:45 PM] &lt;michel_v&gt; but in Europe we make two times less on average
<br />[5:46 PM] &lt;shep&gt; what is the cost?
<br />[5:46 PM] &lt;michel_v&gt; 200 euros for two days
<br />[5:46 PM] &lt;shep&gt; (in US dollars)
<br />[5:46 PM] &lt;michel_v&gt; add the price for whatever cool thing you want to buy that does not exceed 100 dollars
<br />[5:46 PM] &lt;michel_v&gt; and you got the price in dollars
<br />[5:46 PM] &lt;Podz&gt; $234
<br />[5:47 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; pity not coming to bromley 
<br />[5:47 PM] &lt;anthonymcg&gt; 200 euro?!
<br />[5:47 PM] &lt;mumbles&gt; i know bromley well enough to recommend something;p
<br />[5:48 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; unless there are nay other pressing matters, we can call it
<br />[5:49 PM] &lt;Podz&gt; none here
<br />[5:49 PM] &lt;photomatt_lap&gt; alright then, &lt;/meetup&gt;

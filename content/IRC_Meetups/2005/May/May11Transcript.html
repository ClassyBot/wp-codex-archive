<p>Photomatt reminded us that 1.5.1 was released and the crowd said "yay".
No updates to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/04May2005#New.2FImproved_Logo">new logo design</a> but color is on the horizon.
The WP.Com domain is way out of our price range but the Wordpress.com domain is being transferred.
</p><p><br />
Even though Photomatt tried to explain that the logo was deep into its design process and pretty much set, the group would have none of that!

<ul><li> The new W was dubbed "the bulb" and is referred to as such throughout the rest of the conversation.
<ul><li> skippy "may I ask why the W has a "bulb" on the right end in the logo? It looks ... odd."</li>
<li> Firas "yeah, if opinions are counted, the bulb seems out of place"</li>
<li> masquerade "I don't necessarily "like" the bulb, but I think if it was removed it would look a little plain"</li>
<li> ryanduff|laptop "it needs something, just not a bulb"</li>
<li> Blackb|rd "as for the bulby W: it may become the "Wordpress W" which in turn makes it easy to have really tiny logos signifying WP stuff."</li></ul></li>
<li> factoryjoe "have you thought about the license on the font at all?"
<ul><li> photomatt "we could certainly distribute vectors of the logo without sending out the whole font"</li></ul></li>
<li> photomatt "speaking of shirts"
<ul><li> photomatt "we got an email a few days ago from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.spreadshirt.com/">http://www.spreadshirt.com/</a> they want to promote themselves to bloggers"</li>
<li> photomatt "Opera uses spreadshirt for their US and EU stores"</li>
<li> westi "from my experiences in doing t-shirts (I organised halls t-shirts at uni two years running) there pricing is reasonable too"</li>
<li> photomatt "I'm going to see if we can get a sample from them, if the quality looks good perhaps we can give them a spot on the forums for a month in exchange for a deal on shirts"</li></ul></li>
<li> carthik "what will be usage restrictions on the logo/brand be?"
<ul><li> Firas "Is WP going to be trademarked?"</li>
<li> photomatt "WordPress is being trademarked, yes. it needs to be for protection, as wordpress.com showed us</li>
<li> factoryjoe "i started a conversation w/ the creative commons guys about doing to trademark what they've done for copyright"</li>
<li> photomatt "don't use "wordpress" in your domain or site name, everything else is fair"</li>
<li> factoryjoe "that's the problem... you can't just say that. the law doesn't allow you to if you're going to "protect it""</li>
<li> photomatt "I know"</li>
<li> factoryjoe "hence we need an alternative. in any case, this is real issue to consider sooner than later as you move fwd w/ trademark. roping the CC guys in now would be smart I think"</li></ul></li></ul>

<ul><li> relle "The Codex is really tightening up and I'd like to see some responsiblity assigned to volunteers to coordinate efforts."
<ul><li> relle "After the name of the admin, I'd like to see areas of responsibility."</li>
<li> twistedraisin "what do you need the volunteers to do?"</li>
<li> relle ""So if someone comes in and is a plugin expert, I would know to send them to X who is in charge of plugin information on the codex. If someone wants to help with Lessons, they would know that this is my baby."</li>
<li> relle "A lot of people come in and say I want to help, I'm good at X and then they are ignored."</li>
<li> photomatt "I don't know if the docs team is big enough for that"</li>
<li> relle "Why not?"</li>
<li> skippy "at a high-level, I think it would work."</li>
<li> Semiologic "relle: i think a better approach would be to simply making it more obvious who is maintaining the codex"</li>
<li> relle "Already people like macmanx handle themes and plugins - so why not say so on the list."</li>
<li> photomatt "this list? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Listadmins">http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Listadmins</a>"</li>
<li> photomatt "that page isn't editable"</li>
<li> carthik "I think the way it works now is fine: we have a few SysOps admins, clearly listed, and I just edited the few pages introducing the Codex to new volunteers that those are the people to contact in case of confusion, as also sending a mail to the wp-docs list."</li>
<li> relle "The new <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks">http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks</a> Task List Carthik and I put together is ready and waiting for people to sign up and get involved and I'd like to see people help direct the efforts."</li>
<li> twistedraisin "I don't mind volunteering, I just haven't been sure where my effort is needed as of yet."</li>
<li> relle "twistedraisin, that's a great example of what I'm getting at."</li>
<li> relle "If people know that Lorelle is in charge of Lessons - then they could leave a message on my user page and I could direct their energies."</li>
<li> photomatt "maybe if the <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Contributing">http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Contributing</a> page could have a better call to action"</li></ul></li>
<li> masquerade "While on the wiki, why not set it as a redirect to the codex?"
<ul><li> MCincubus "There is some really old 1.2 stuff on wiki that could actually be doing harm."</li>
<li> photomatt "on wiki.wordpress.org?"</li>
<li>  MCincubus nods</li>
<li> photomatt "ideally the relevant articles should redirect to the new wiki"</li>
<li> photomatt "relle: perhaps the task for the next few weeks could be transitioning the old wiki more finally"</li>
<li> photomatt "relle: would you like to be the person who assigns incoming victims volunteers to the codex?"</li>
<li> relle "I'll think about it"</li></ul></li></ul>

<ul><li> twistedraisin "Ryan was nailing down patch stuff for RSS today, I think. Matt had mentioned a few other things worth taking care of before the next dot release went out"</li>
<li> photomatt "the plan is to get the confirmed patches in the source ASAP"</li>

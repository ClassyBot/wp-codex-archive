<br />[17:00] * Parts: error_bot ("io_error"�)
<br />[17:00] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; okay then, let's get started&#160;:)
<br />[17:00] &lt;Podz&gt; &lt;meetup&gt;
<br />[17:00] * Joins: skeltoac|busy
<br />[17:00] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; MCincubus: still blank

<br />[17:01] &lt;MCincubus&gt; mdawaffe, "Topics"
<br />[17:01] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; I'd like to make a few announcements up front
<br />[17:01] * Joins: stevecooley
<br />[17:01] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; MCincubus: ah - mind if I move it around?
<br />[17:01] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; first, sorry for the forum issues last night, I made a mistake
<br />[17:01] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; should be fixed now
<br />[17:01] &lt;Podz&gt; np&#160;:)
<br />[17:01] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; and everyone should oooh and ahhhh at the AJAX posting&#160;:)
<br />[17:01] &lt;MCincubus&gt; mdawaffe, pretty it up all you like
<br />[17:02] &lt;MCincubus&gt; okay, now I have to go find an issue to respond to just to test it out
<br />[17:02] &lt;jalenack&gt; mdawaffe, that was some quick bugfixing for that ticket I added. nice one
<br />[17:02] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; jalenack: ding!
<br />[17:02] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; mdawaffe has been making some great improvements to the forums, I think the community is benefiting a lot from his work
<br />[17:03] &lt;Podz&gt; I'd agree there certainly
<br />[17:03] &lt;MCincubus&gt; also his work on WordPress bugs ++
<br />[17:03] * Quits: photomatt_wrk
<br />[17:03] &lt;io_error&gt; hm, well then
<br />[17:03] &lt;jalenack&gt; heh
<br />[17:03] &lt;MCincubus&gt; &lt;meetup_limbo&gt;
<br />[17:04] * Blackb|rd starts picking his nose.
<br />[17:04] * graeme kick's photomatt_wrk&#160;: too much yammering!
<br />[17:04] &lt;Blackb|rd&gt; oh. sorry.
<br />[17:04] * io_error breaks out a deck of cards
<br />[17:04] * jalenack tries to stay calm
<br />[17:04] &lt;io_error&gt; texas hold'em anybody?
<br />[17:04] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; Quick, someone throw out an issue.
<br />[17:05] &lt;masquerade&gt; io_error, deal me in
<br />[17:05] &lt;jalenack&gt; deal me in too
<br />[17:05] * Joins: photomatt_wrk
<br />[17:05] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; whoops, sorry
<br />[17:05] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; speaking of, photomatt_wrk the WP AJAX has been patched
<br />[17:05] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; mdawaffe: make sure it's tagged as commit candidate
<br />[17:05] &lt;jonthejester&gt; I saw something on AJAX posting...when was that added?
<br />[17:05] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; k
<br />[17:05] &lt;relle&gt; Is the ajax thing the yellow fade out on a new post?
<br />[17:06] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; yeah it doesn't do a reload
<br />[17:06] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; also deleting is really slick
<br />[17:06] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; I'm hoping we can port some of that to WP as well
<br />[17:06] &lt;jonthejester&gt; Slick, did you just add that (photo)matt?
<br />[17:06] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; mdawaffe is the ajax guru of the week&#160;:)
<br />[17:06] &lt;relle&gt; but the yellow fade thing is really painful on the eyes. A mellow blue might be nicer.
<br />[17:06] &lt;MCincubus&gt; photomatt_wrk, yeah... Typo-like stuff would be cool
<br />[17:06] &lt;masquerade&gt; photomatt_wrk, comments would perhaps be a nice place for that sort of AJAX
<br />[17:06] * Quits: geoffrey ("ouch... gotta run!"�)
<br />[17:07] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; MCincubus: typo is going to look shabby after 1.6
<br />[17:07] &lt;MCincubus&gt; w00t
<br />[17:07] &lt;jonthejester&gt; lol&#160;:)
<br />[17:07] &lt;ringmaster&gt; What library are we using, generally, for Ajax?
<br />[17:07] &lt;jalenack&gt; Sack
<br />[17:08] &lt;jalenack&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://twilightuniverse.com/2005/05/sack-of-ajax/">http://twilightuniverse.com/2005/05/sack-of-ajax/</a>
<br />[17:08] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Cool.
<br />[17:08] &lt;MCincubus&gt; there have been problems with ajax plugins conflicting... would be nice to have a unified method so plugins don't bump heads
<br />[17:08] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; agreed
<br />[17:08] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Note agenda item #3.
<br />[17:08] &lt;jonthejester&gt; same here
<br />[17:09] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; MCincubus: WP 1.6 now comes with sack, so people should use that
<br />[17:09] &lt;jalenack&gt; and dojo is only for admin panel then?
<br />[17:09] &lt;ringmaster&gt; No Dojo in source that I've seen.
<br />[17:10] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; sacks the only ajax, I think, unless I missed something.  Everything else is "just" JS
<br />[17:10] * Joins: lastnode
<br />[17:10] &lt;ringmaster&gt; I've remodeled my media stuff to use sack where once it used Dojo.
<br />[17:10] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; cool
<br />[17:10] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; I don't think dojo is quite ready
<br />[17:11] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; or at least is too complicated for our uses
<br />[17:11] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; the second announcement is that I'm working on getting the Codex back up
<br />[17:11] &lt;jalenack&gt; fantastic
<br />[17:11] * graeme claps
<br />[17:11] &lt;io_error&gt; yes!!!
<br />[17:11] &lt;PotterSys&gt; w00t!
<br />[17:12] * lastnode applauds
<br />[17:12] &lt;MCincubus&gt; ETA?
<br />[17:12] * relle taps her foot and waits for the other shoe to drop.
<br />[17:12] &lt;io_error&gt; heh
<br />[17:12] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; there had been some custom mods to apache which were preventing logins from working
<br />[17:12] &lt;relle&gt;&#160;;-)
<br />[17:12] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; and the guy who was handling it was out of town, so I've been kinda stuck
<br />[17:12] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; now he's back and we're back on track
<br />[17:13] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; eta: soon! *cough*
<br />[17:13] &lt;lastnode&gt; i've been working some stuff on a local mediawiki install, so it'l be cool to be able to transfer it up
<br />[17:13] &lt;io_error&gt; RSN?
<br />[17:14] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; what's RSN?
<br />[17:14] &lt;io_error&gt; Real Soon Now
<br />[17:14] &lt;relle&gt; "really soon now"?
<br />[17:14] &lt;relle&gt; lol
<br />[17:14] &lt;lastnode&gt;&#160;:)
<br />[17:14] &lt;io_error&gt; .g "real soon now"
<br />[17:14] * io_error notes lack of bots
<br />[17:14] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; ah
<br />[17:14] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; we need more TLAs

<br />[17:15] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; okay moving on in the agenda
<br />[17:15] &lt;lastnode&gt; mmm acronym soup
<br />[17:15] &lt;io_error&gt; I hate when google does that to me
<br />[17:15] &lt;stevecooley&gt; no problem, as long as your computer has LRF support
<br />[17:15] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; " Using "secret keys" to protect admin functions from XSS - MCincubus"
<br />[17:15] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; MCincubus: did you want to start that topic off?
<br />[17:16] &lt;MCincubus&gt; We still have XSS vulnerabilities, and not everyone has referrers on, (say for mobile clients).  I think the best method would be a unique key (maybe based off of admin password + salt MD5d)
<br />[17:17] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; okay, to clarify
<br />[17:17] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; there are no current XSS exploits
<br />[17:17] &lt;MCincubus&gt; erm...
<br />[17:17] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; adding a static unique key and removing referrers would actually open us up to XSS
<br />[17:17] &lt;io_error&gt; would you like me to write one?&#160;:)
<br />[17:18] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; because JS could read the static key before filing off the request
<br />[17:18] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; the way other programs address this is through nonces
<br />[17:18] &lt;ringmaster&gt; I like the idea of using nonces for XSS protection.  Any thoughts on how to do it that way instead?
<br />[17:18] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; however I think having nonces as well as referrer protection can't hurt
<br />[17:19] &lt;MCincubus&gt; there is currently at least one page that has no protection at all.
<br />[17:19] &lt;MCincubus&gt; at least, as far as I can tell
<br />[17:20] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; well then email me and I'll check it
<br />[17:20] &lt;MCincubus&gt; alright.  So what's the deal with nonces?
<br />[17:21] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1585.html">http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1585.html</a>
<br />[17:21] &lt;ringmaster&gt; It's basically a one-off version of what you already described, right?
<br />[17:21] &lt;MCincubus&gt; stored in the db?
<br />[17:22] &lt;ringmaster&gt; That seems inefficient.
<br />[17:24] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; I don't see it as a terribly high priority right now, however if we could find a way to automatically protect the forms in WP without having to change every file that'd be ideal
<br />[17:24] &lt;MCincubus&gt; well, we'd need to insert the field into the form...
<br />[17:25] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; if we could have some sort of output buffer that protected all forms or something
<br />[17:25] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; anyway, food for thought
<br />[17:25] &lt;masquerade&gt; or add a JS that inserts the form element, output buffers can get messy
<br />[17:25] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; this should probably be discussed more on the hackers list
<br />[17:25] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; MCincubus: email me if you think you've found someplace not protected
<br />[17:26] &lt;MCincubus&gt; security@wordpress.org?
<br />[17:26] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; yep
<br />[17:26] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; alright, next up
<br />[17:26] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; " Couple current bugs in forums to watch out for -- mdawaffe"
<br />[17:26] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; mdawaffe?
<br />[17:26] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; yeah
<br />[17:27] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; If you reply to a topic that has 30 posts on it already, your post might show up at the bottom as 31 or i might not show up at all (it sort of depends_)
<br />[17:27] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; it's on the NEXT page, but there's not link to that next page yet
<br />[17:27] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; do a hard refresh to get everything squared
<br />[17:28] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; oh - and the forums may not work on some older browsers - parts of the code don't degrade as nicely as they should yet
<br />[17:28] &lt;Podz&gt; I'll try Lynx&#160;:)
<br />[17:28] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; (and if someone could quick test posting out on IE just to verify, that'd be cool)
<br />[17:28] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; Podz: I think it will actually work on lynx...
<br />[17:29] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; not tried it though&#160;:)
<br />[17:29] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; why not just ban IE outright?
<br />[17:29] * lastnode supports that totally
<br />[17:29] &lt;Podz&gt; mdawaffe:: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/42814#post-240265">http://wordpress.org/support/topic/42814#post-240265</a>  I see no name&#160;?
<br />[17:29] &lt;Podz&gt; IE6 ^^
<br />[17:29] &lt;lastnode&gt; why should we even bother?&#160;:)
<br />[17:29] &lt;MCincubus&gt; ... because we'd have to register as a religious organization, likely.
<br />[17:29] &lt;jalenack&gt; that'd be filtering out all the people who need support&#160;:p
<br />[17:29] &lt;lastnode&gt; the cult of wordpress
<br />[17:29] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; Because you can't ignore the majority.
<br />[17:30] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; Podz: refresh?
<br />[17:30] &lt;MCincubus&gt; Death to the IEfidels
<br />[17:30] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; IE is miserable
<br />[17:30] &lt;Podz&gt; nope - looks broken too. hang on
<br />[17:30] &lt;skeltoac|busy&gt; It's not hard to cancel AJAXification for IE users.
<br />[17:30] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; let me just go on record with that
<br />[17:30] * io_error hates IE
<br />[17:31] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; Podz: I think that must be due to a CSS change I had Matt apply
<br />[17:31] &lt;MCincubus&gt; well, at least ensure that the fallback method works...
<br />[17:31] * jalenack opens explorer/mac
<br />[17:31] &lt;stevecooley&gt;&#160;:D
<br />[17:31] &lt;masquerade&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://browsehappy.com/">http://browsehappy.com/</a> &lt;-- we should display links there if people are using IE, it is "Brought to you by WordPress after all"&#160;;-)

<br />[17:31] &lt;masquerade&gt; er, put that after all outside of that quote
<br />[17:31] &lt;MCincubus&gt; masquerade, top of my site does that
<br />[17:31] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; skeltoac|busy: yeah - currently some of the forms are hardcoded with non degrading AJAX
<br />[17:31] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; that'll change
<br />[17:31] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; wow that's ugly
<br />[17:32] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; I'll test it out in IE and work with mdawaffe after the meetup
<br />[17:32] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; I don't think he has regular access to win/ie
<br />[17:32] &lt;skeltoac|busy&gt; mdawaffe: Ewww.
<br />[17:32] &lt;io_error&gt; odd
<br />[17:32] * io_error posts in IE
<br />[17:32] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; skeltoac|busy: care to patch it?
<br />[17:32] &lt;io_error&gt; nobody's names are showing up?
<br />[17:32] &lt;MCincubus&gt; looks strange in FF 1.06/Linux too
<br />[17:32] &lt;jalenack&gt; ok ie/mac is handles alright
<br />[17:32] * io_error takes a screenshot
<br />[17:32] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; MCincubus: you're kidding me
<br />[17:32] &lt;skeltoac|busy&gt; I've always rolled my own AJAX so I don't know the libraries... but now that I've vomited an exused I'll try&#160;:)
<br />[17:32] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; son of a
<br />[17:32] &lt;jalenack&gt; some css niggles
<br />[17:33] &lt;Podz&gt; no names
<br />[17:33] &lt;MCincubus&gt; mdawaffe, the "download" link
<br />[17:33] &lt;masquerade&gt; I'm missing the purpose of two serach boxes

<br />[17:33] &lt;Podz&gt; mind - if IE is having all these problems, no-one is saying anything&#160;:)
<br />[17:33] &lt;masquerade&gt; io_error, strange, its all find here
<br />[17:34] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; skeltoac|busy: it's not in the AJAX, it's the way the forms are coded, actually, bad return values on submit etc.
<br />[17:34] &lt;skeltoac|busy&gt; Ohh...
<br />[17:34] &lt;masquerade&gt; fine*

<br />[17:34] &lt;jalenack&gt; reload
<br />[17:34] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; IE5/mac I don't care about at all
<br />[17:34] &lt;jalenack&gt; yeah, don't worry about the AJAX at all for iemac
<br />[17:35] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; (but it seems to do better than IE/win)
<br />[17:35] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; Podz: ok - thanks
<br />[17:35] * Parts: Blackb|rd
<br />[17:35] &lt;jalenack&gt; there's a 1px gutter on the right side of the site
<br />[17:36] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; let's save this for after the meetup
<br />[17:36] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; we can have a CSS bug fix in #wordpress after we're done
<br />[17:36] &lt;jalenack&gt; yeah
<br />[17:36] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; wp.com invites for those that find fixes&#160;:)
<br />[17:36] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; haha
<br />[17:36] * MCincubus won't report the problem until he finds a fix&#160;:-)
<br />[17:36] &lt;io_error&gt; heh, he's serious&#160;:)
<br />[17:37] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; " Thoughts on moving sharable js in WP to a new directory - ringmaster"
<br />[17:37] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; I think that's a great idea
<br />[17:37] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; (why spend time fixing CSS when you could just bid on an invite....&#160;;) )
<br />[17:37] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Candidates include TinyMCE, fat, and sack.  Possibly others.
<br />[17:37] * mdawaffe notes we do it in bbPress
<br />[17:37] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; bb-scripts
<br />[17:38] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; let me preface that with that we're trying as hard as possible to reduce root-level clutter
<br />[17:38] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; which would include a new top-level directory
<br />[17:38] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; wp-content/scripts
<br />[17:38] * io_error likes reducing clutter
<br />[17:38] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; wp-images is the next to go
<br />[17:38] &lt;masquerade&gt; it'd be better in wp-includes
<br />[17:38] &lt;jonthejester&gt; or what about wp-includes/scripts&#160;?
<br />[17:38] &lt;skeltoac|busy&gt; They seem like content more than includes
<br />[17:38] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; mdawaffe: wp-content is for things that don't get updated by WP
<br />[17:38] &lt;MCincubus&gt; includes is my vote
<br />[17:38] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; FACT
<br />[17:38] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; I'm inclined to put them in includes
<br />[17:38] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; includes it is
<br />[17:38] &lt;jonthejester&gt; same here
<br />[17:38] &lt;io_error&gt; yep
<br />[17:38] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; okay, I'll do that then
<br />[17:38] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt;&#160;:)
<br />[17:39] &lt;MCincubus&gt; if a user wants to make their OWN JS it should go in content
<br />[17:39] &lt;skeltoac|busy&gt; Oh right. Upgrades. Includes.
<br />[17:39] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; MCincubus: good call
<br />[17:39] &lt;ringmaster&gt; One point...
<br />[17:39] &lt;MCincubus&gt; er, s/user/plugin
<br />[17:39] &lt;jalenack&gt; and will this get included by default, even if there aren't any plugins using it?
<br />[17:39] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; it's used by the WP backend
<br />[17:39] &lt;masquerade&gt; jalenack, since its JS and not PHP, probably not
<br />[17:39] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; so it's included by default
<br />[17:39] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Is it ok that a page looks in a subdir of wp-includes, allowing visitors to see the wp-includes dir exists?
<br />[17:39] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; ohwait
<br />[17:39] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; no they won't be linked by default
<br />[17:39] &lt;jalenack&gt; there could be a plugin hook
<br />[17:39] &lt;jalenack&gt; that could turn it on
<br />[17:39] &lt;MCincubus&gt; a switch
<br />[17:40] &lt;MCincubus&gt; not a free for all... just, once one has flipped it, it gets put into the head
<br />[17:40] &lt;io_error&gt; ringmaster: people can already see that wp-content, and wp-includes, and wp-admin, etc., exist
<br />[17:40] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; these are all going to be JS, right?
<br />[17:40] &lt;jalenack&gt; exactly
<br />[17:40] &lt;masquerade&gt; ringmaster, anyone could find the wp-includes directory easily
<br />[17:40] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; just hook into wp-head and add the line to include the js file
<br />[17:40] &lt;jalenack&gt; as in, no OFF switch, just an on-switch
<br />[17:40] &lt;ringmaster&gt; How do you easily find the wp-includes directory?
<br />[17:40] &lt;MCincubus&gt; mdawaffe, but multiple plugins
<br />[17:40] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Do themes reference files from there?
<br />[17:40] &lt;masquerade&gt; ringmaster, go to the login form, look at the redirect, change that wp-admin to wp-includes in the URI...
<br />[17:40] &lt;io_error&gt; ringmaster: a one-line index.php fixes the problem: &lt;?php header("Location: ../");&#160;?&gt; it's not clean, but it works&#160;:)
<br />[17:40] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; MCincubus: ah - I see - always thinking for me, aren't you MCincubus&#160;:)
<br />[17:41] * Quits: lastnode (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)�)
<br />[17:41] &lt;masquerade&gt; ringmaster, or, look at the links to the CSS, those go to wp-content, change it to wp-includes
<br />[17:41] &lt;MCincubus&gt; there should be a wp_use_js(); or something
<br />[17:41] &lt;jalenack&gt; yes
<br />[17:41] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Why, as a visitor, would I know to change it to wp-includes?
<br />[17:41] &lt;io_error&gt; or Options -Indexes
<br />[17:41] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; tinymce is a lot to load if you only want sack
<br />[17:42] &lt;masquerade&gt; ringmaster, we shouldn't be worried about visitors, its exploits that we should be worried about
<br />[17:42] &lt;MCincubus&gt; mdawaffe, point.  a switch for each functional group
<br />[17:42] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; wp_use_js('tw-sack.js')
<br />[17:42] &lt;skeltoac|busy&gt; function include_sack() { if ($GLOBALS['wp_sack_loaded'] return true; addaction('wp_head', 'wp_include_sack'); return true; } function wp_include_sack() { echo "&lt;script..."; }
<br />[17:42] Auto away:� 30mins of no action
<br />[17:42] Auto Away deactivated, manual Away set:�10 Auto Away:� 30mins of no action
<br />[17:42] Auto away is active
<br />[17:42] &lt;MCincubus&gt; skeltoac|busy, exactly
<br />[17:42] &lt;skeltoac|busy&gt; Oops, forgot to set $GLOBALS['wp_sack_loaded'] after done...
<br />[17:42] * Joins: lastnode
<br />[17:43] &lt;MCincubus&gt; heh, well... general idea
<br />[17:43] &lt;masquerade&gt; skeltoac|busy, let's not contribute to global variable pollution, how about an array of items loaded instead
<br />[17:43] &lt;skeltoac|busy&gt; Sure, whatever. General idea.
<br />[17:43] &lt;skeltoac|busy&gt; Global array.
<br />[17:43] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; I like one function that takes a filename instead of several functions
<br />[17:43] &lt;ringmaster&gt; masquerade: By permitting outside access to a subdir in wp-includes, would we expose any of the code in wp-includes to attackers?
<br />[17:43] Back:� Away for 31mins 6secs
<br />[17:43] Away Deactivated:�4 Auto Away reactivated
<br />[17:43] &lt;MCincubus&gt; mdawaffe, as do I... because it could be used for add-on JS
<br />[17:44] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; MCincubus: exactly
<br />[17:44] &lt;skeltoac|busy&gt; nice
<br />[17:44] &lt;ringmaster&gt; What I mean is, currently we can disallow access to wp-includes for browsers and it doesn't hurt WP.
<br />[17:44] &lt;MCincubus&gt; like... blank index.php?
<br />[17:44] &lt;lastnode&gt; or .htaccess?
<br />[17:44] &lt;ringmaster&gt; No, like loading site/wp-includes/class.php
<br />[17:44] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Directly.
<br />[17:44] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; it would need to be able to take a larger path, though.  So JS could be put in wp-content/plugins
<br />[17:45] &lt;masquerade&gt; ringmaster, I'm not really seeing the point here....
<br />[17:45] &lt;lastnode&gt; ringmaster, wouldn't that be solved with a simple redirect rule?
<br />[17:45] &lt;MCincubus&gt; mdawaffe, yeah, we'll have to hash out some of those details later
<br />[17:45] &lt;skeltoac|busy&gt; wp-content is already generally open but we don't want core js in there. maybe a little root clutter is in order after all.
<br />[17:45] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; skeltoac|busy: plugin JS in wp-content, core in wp-includes/scripts
<br />[17:46] &lt;masquerade&gt; I agree with the wp-includes/scripts
<br />[17:46] &lt;MCincubus&gt; I hate root clutter.  SO MANY people install WP in the root dir of their website...
<br />[17:46] * lastnode agrees
<br />[17:46] &lt;ringmaster&gt; So there's no danger in running any file in wp-includes directly?
<br />[17:46] &lt;MCincubus&gt; ringmaster, should get function undefined error real fast
<br />[17:46] &lt;io_error&gt; MCincubus: yep, and I'm one of them
<br />[17:47] &lt;masquerade&gt; Who cares if anyone can load up any of the files, its not getting them anywhere. You'd have include errors, undefined function errors, etc.
<br />[17:47] &lt;skeltoac|busy&gt; ringmaster: None of them include()s wp-config
<br />[17:47] &lt;MCincubus&gt; same with theme files
<br />[17:47] &lt;MCincubus&gt; get_header(); and the party ends there
<br />[17:47] &lt;ringmaster&gt; That may be the case.  It's more safe to consider the security implications first.
<br />[17:47] &lt;ringmaster&gt; If you all have done that so quickly, then boo-yah for you.
<br />[17:48] &lt;masquerade&gt; ringmaster, there have been no security issues with it to date, I doubt putting JS there is going tob e any more of a problem
<br />[17:48] &lt;skeltoac|busy&gt; Okay by me then.
<br />[17:48] &lt;masquerade&gt; attackers can find wp-includes easily, its no chore
<br />[17:48] &lt;lastnode&gt; ringmaster&#160;: access to the php files doesn't mean there's anything to execute in them, right?
<br />[17:48] &lt;ringmaster&gt; No, it doesn't.
<br />[17:48] &lt;lastnode&gt; arent the includes just functions used elsewhere?
<br />[17:49] &lt;masquerade&gt; lastnode, essentially
<br />[17:49] &lt;ringmaster&gt; All I'm asking is to continue to consider the security implications of this choice.
<br />[17:49] &lt;MCincubus&gt; lastnode, some of them run stuff
<br />[17:49] &lt;ringmaster&gt; There are plenty of places where SQL insertion wasn't expected and it was found.
<br />[17:49] &lt;MCincubus&gt; I think classes.php tries to start a new WP_Query instance
<br />[17:49] &lt;lastnode&gt; then, as I said earlier, wouldn't a rewrite rule work?
<br />[17:49] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; ringmaster: I hope the security implications of any choice are considered
<br />[17:49] &lt;ringmaster&gt; It's better to be SURE than say, "It should be fine."
<br />[17:49] &lt;MCincubus&gt; ringmaster, that's true, but without wp-config.php, no SQL
<br />[17:49] &lt;lastnode&gt; i agree, it should be considered
<br />[17:50] * Joins: geoffrey
<br />[17:50] &lt;masquerade&gt; ringmaster, I'm really not seeing anything at all that could be dangerous, wp-includes has been perfectly open to everyone up till now, adding another set of files there isn't going to make it any more dangerous
<br />[17:50] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; okay, sounds good
<br />[17:50] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; are there any outstanding issues people wanted to raise?
<br />[17:51] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; We're still having flooding problems in #wordpress

<br />[17:51] &lt;jonthejester&gt; tinymce doesn't do completely valid aligning, but it might be minor
<br />[17:52] &lt;lastnode&gt; photomatt_wrk&#160;: there is a problem sometimes with problem users
<br />[17:52] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; where?
<br />[17:52] &lt;lastnode&gt; i think there needs to be a way some of the senior members around here can get opship and do temp bans
<br />[17:52] &lt;MCincubus&gt; photomatt_wrk, I have some WP 1.6 bugs you might be interested in for wp.com (not now, just before you jet)
<br />[17:52] &lt;lastnode&gt; photomatt_wrk&#160;: it hasn't been a recurring problem, but i assume it will be, as wp grows?
<br />[17:52] &lt;graeme&gt; tunicwriter: can we make the bots take care of that?
<br />[17:52] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; ringmaster: can you make sure I'm right on this

<br />[17:53] &lt;io_error&gt; Bots shouldn't be making decisions that require human evaluation - not yet anyway.
<br />[17:53] &lt;graeme&gt; io_error: flood.. though, that's pretty objective.
<br />[17:53] &lt;io_error&gt; graeme: suppose one of our regular users accidentally pastes 7 or 8 lines or whatever the threshold is

<br />[17:54] &lt;MCincubus&gt; got my clipboards mixed up
<br />[17:54] &lt;lastnode&gt; mcincubus&#160;: yeah, what im referring to is "nightwalker"
<br />[17:54] &lt;masquerade&gt; Yeah, I often accidentally flood paste also, it happens
<br />[17:54] &lt;graeme&gt; if you don't want to have people get teh kicked, you can have a gentle message /msg'd to e'em.
<br />[17:54] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; ringmaster: no worries - ran up against it in bbPress (into which I've ganked your code)
<br />[17:54] &lt;io_error&gt; graeme: we generally need a human to determine whether someone is causing trouble or just dropped their mouse
<br />[17:54] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; thanks, btw
<br />[17:54] &lt;graeme&gt; "oy, no flooding, flood in wp-flood"

<br />[17:54] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; yeah
<br />[17:54] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Cool.
<br />[17:55] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; pretty sure I applied your diffs in bb before WP got to them
<br />[17:55] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Heh.
<br />[17:55] * Quits: lastnode (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)�)
<br />[17:55] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; it's a nice system - bb has about 7 meta_caps

<br />[17:56] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; otherwise, &lt;/meetup&gt;
<br />[17:56] &lt;io_error&gt; what we do need, at least for now, is for a few of the regular trusted users to have ops, in case someone does come around starting trouble
<br />[17:56] &lt;io_error&gt; speak of the devil
<br />[17:56] &lt;stevecooley&gt; no update on the theme browser, eh
<br />[17:56] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; ringmaster: bb doesn't store roles in the DB, just user caps
<br />[17:56] &lt;lastnode&gt; io_error&#160;: i agree
<br />[17:56] &lt;ringmaster&gt; mdawaffe: So no roles in bb?
<br />[17:56] &lt;Podz&gt; stevecooley:: there was a thread in the forums

<br />[17:56] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; there are - they're just hardwired
<br />[17:56] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; MCincubus: cool

<br />[17:58] &lt;MCincubus&gt; pingbacks broken on same site with rich text editor, and pingbacks broken when using fancy URIs
<br />[17:58] &lt;graeme&gt; also... i think the downloads shouldn't be labeled with the date and maybe wordpress rather than latest.tar.gz
<br />[17:58] &lt;ringmaster&gt; mdawaffe:  caps.php needs a list of used caps with a plugin hook to filter them.
<br />[17:58] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; indeed
<br />[17:58] &lt;masquerade&gt; graeme, I'm pretty sure we've been over this before here and on hackers
<br />[17:58] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; I keep meaning to do that
<br />[17:59] &lt;ringmaster&gt; As soon as that is done, the role editor can begin.
<br />[17:59] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Hardcoded roles are weird. &#160;:)
<br />[17:59] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; no options table in bb&#160;:)
<br />[17:59] &lt;graeme&gt; masquerade: alright then, as long as you've all got good reasons for keeping a lot of things labeled latest that aren't latest around.. that's cool by me.
<br />[18:00] &lt;ringmaster&gt; mdawaffe: Creepy. &#160;:)
<br />[18:00] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; heh - keeps SQL to a min, though
<br />[18:00] &lt;MCincubus&gt; it's the latest stable, which is the latest that any normal user should be downloading.
<br />[18:00] &lt;ringmaster&gt; mdawaffe: You could still build a non-role user and just assign caps, right?
<br />[18:00] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; ringmaster: yes - all that naturally gets stored in usermeta
<br />[18:00] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; graeme: if you download with a normal DL client it renames the file
<br />[18:01] &lt;photomatt_wrk&gt; to wordpress-version.tar.gz
<br />[18:01] &lt;ringmaster&gt; mdawaffe: It's all good, then. &#160;:)

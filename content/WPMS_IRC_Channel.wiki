There is an IRC for WordPress and WPMS. Join #wordpress on irc.freenode.net with your favourite IRC client.

The fastest way to access the channel is the [http://webchat.freenode.net/ freenode web chat]. One easy to use IRC client program is [http://gaim.sourceforge.net/ Gaim].

It is useful because people can answer your question more quickly and interactively, so it might be fruitful to ask there first or simultaneously with a posted question on the [[WPMS Forums]].  If you do so, posting a link to the forum question in the irc channel would be convenient for others.

The [https://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress channel is logged], so mind what you say if you mind that others might mind what you say.

In the multisite version of WordPress, there is another layer of administration called Network Admin.

Upon installation, the admin user is created automatically. They have network admin, or "super admin" powers over the entire site. They are able to access and manage every site on the system, regardless of individual site settings.

If you are logged in as a Network Admin, you will see a 'My Sites' option in the [[Administration_Screens#Toolbar|Toolbar]]. Just under this menu, you will find the path to the Network Admin dashboard.

Inside the Network Admin dashboard, menus include:

* Dashboard
* Sites
* Users
* Themes
* Plugins
* Settings
* Updates

; Dashboard : this menu item is more of a landing page and has a search box for sites and users

; Sites : this is the site management page. You can see a list of sites on the system with their users, with edit links to the site's details and to their backends. You can also manually add sites here via the 'Add New' button near the top of the page.

; Users : manage all the users on the system, and it also lists the sites of each user.

; Themes : this menu is for network-wide enabling and disabling of themes. A theme must be enabled here before it is visible to member sites.

; Plugins : this menu is for network-wide activation and deactivation of plugins

; Settings : probably the most important menu for network management. All network options are available here.

; Updates : this menu item is used to allow an automated update of the sites in a network.

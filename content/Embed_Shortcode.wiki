The '''Embed''' feature allows you to wrap [[Embeds|embedded items]] using a simple [[Shortcode]] to set of a maximum (but not fixed) width and height. This was added as of WordPress [[Version 2.9|2.9]] and is used like this:

 [embed]...[/embed]

== Usage ==

I have an embedded item, and I want to set max dimensions:

 [embed width="123" height="456"]...[/embed]

'''Note:''' This shortcode isn't enabled until <tt>[[Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/the_content | 'the_content']]</tt> filter has been processed at least once.  If you need to run this shortcode before or without [[The_Loop|The Loop]] and aren't using <tt>[[Function_Reference/the_content | the_content()]]</tt> you'll need to call the following method with the content which contains the [embed] shortcode: 

  $GLOBALS['wp_embed']->run_shortcode( 'Content with [embed] shortcode' );

== Options ==

The following basic options are supported:

{{Parameter|width|integer|Defines width of the media.|optional}}

{{Parameter|height|integer|Defines height of the media.|optional}}

== Source File ==

The embed shortcode is located in {{Trac|wp-includes/class-wp-embed.php}}.

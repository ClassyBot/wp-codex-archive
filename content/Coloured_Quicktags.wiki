There are a variety of [[Using Themes|WordPress Themes]] for your [[Administration Panels]], and you can find some of them in the [[Using Themes/Theme List|Theme List]] for [[Using Themes/Theme List#Admin Themes|Administration Themes]]. There is even an article on designing your own [[Creating Admin Themes|Admin Theme]].

But if you want to just give your WordPress Theme a little face lift, you can quickly and easily add some color to your [[Write Post SubPanel|Write Post]] [[Write Post SubPanel#Quicktags|Quicktag Buttons]].

Found on the '''Write Post''' panel above the '''Post edit''' text area, these handy buttons help you quickly add links, formatting, and images to your post.  With one click, they insert the code for you, allowing you to concentrate on your post content and not the [[Glossary#HTML|HTML]]/[[Glossary#XHTML|XHTML]].

By default, Quicktag buttons look like this:

The buttons above look nice, but you might prefer something less vanilla and more colorful.

=== How do you get cruft free URIs for search results?===
To return clean [[Glossary#URI and URL|URIs]] for search results in WordPress from the search form <nowiki>(www.example.com/search/searchterms instead of www.example.com/?s=searchterms)</nowiki>

First create a file called ''search.php'' which contains:

<pre><?php header('Location: http://www.example.com/search/' . $_GET['s']); ?></pre>

Put that file in the root of your WordPress install and alter the action for the search form to this:

<pre>action="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/search.php"</pre>

===Can I get my profile information as an FOAF file?===

===How do I get .phps files to show up in colored text on my server?===
If you want to have your server display .phps files in color like this [http://carthik.net/wpplugins/updatelinkroll.phps updatelinkroll.phps at carthik.net], add the following line to your .htaccess file in the server root directory.  This assumes your server is Apache and that you have the ability to add types in <tt>.htaccess</tt>
 <tt>AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps</tt>

===How can I do a bulk edit of the Status field for all the posts in my database?===
Use the following SQL commands to change the <tt>post_status</tt> for every post in your [[Database_Description#Table:_wp_posts|wp_posts]] database table.  This command will do the bulk change and exclude Pages from being changed--remember to replace STATUS with '''draft''', '''private''', or '''publish'''. 

 <tt>UPDATE wp_posts  SET post_status = 'STATUS' WHERE post_status != 'static';</tt>

If you have multiple authors and only want to do a bulk edit of just one author's post, you can use the following command, but remember to replace NUMBER with the correct ID number of the <tt>post_author</tt>. 

  <tt>UPDATE wp_posts SET post_status='STATUS' WHERE post_author='NUMBER';</tt>

===How to create a link in my header that links to a URL===

This solution assumes creating a [[Pages|Page]] causes a link to be put in your header.

[[Managing Plugins|Install and activate]] the plugin called [http://redalt.com/Resources/Plugins/Redirectify/download/redirectify Redirectifiy].  Create a Page called Wiki and save that Page.  Then do Manage-&gt;Pages and edit that Page and add the Custom Field with a 'key' of redirect and URL to your Wiki in the value. (That last edit of page is necessary to overcome a bug where you can't assign Custom Fields to a new page, but you can do it when you edit the page.)

<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy">Outreachy</a> (formerly Gnome Outreach Program for Women) is an internship program modeled on Google Summer of Code and administered by the Software Freedom Conservancy that awards stipends to participants who successfully complete a requested free and open-source software project contribution under the guidance of project mentors. This program is intended to increase the participation of women in free software projects and increase the diversity of project contributor pools. In the US, participation is also open to people of color of any gender.

<p>From the Outreachy info pages:
</p>
<blockquote>Each participating organization, with the help of corporate sponsors, will sponsor several internships each from May 23 to August 23, 2016. The internships offered are not limited to coding, but include user experience design, graphic design, documentation, web development, marketing, translation and other types of tasks needed to sustain a FOSS project.
<p>The internship is expected to be a full-time effort, meaning that the participants must be able to spend 40 hours a week on their project. Participants will work remotely from home. Because IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is one of the primary means of communication within FOSS projects, participants should be present on their project's IRC channel while working. You will also be expected to communicate electronically with other project members via other means, including bug tracker comments, mailing list discussion, blog posts, and personal e-mail. Participants will be expected to blog at least once every two weeks about their work and their blog posts will be included on the sites that aggregate blog posts of organization contributors, usually called Planets, and on the Planet Outreach.
</p><p>Both interns and mentors will need to sign the contracts with Software Freedom Conservancy. Software Freedom Conservancy will be administering the payments of the $5,500 (USD) stipends in three installments. In addition, $500 (USD) travel allowance will be available to the interns.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: While Gnome asks for a blog post every 2 weeks, WordPress  participants will be required to submit a blog post/progress report every week, not every two weeks. Also, the WordPress project currently uses Slack rather than IRC for synchronous communication.

<p>Join our team of community organizers and help administer our event and outreach programs, which includes WordCamps, WordPress meetups, training events, charity hackathons, and more. Familiarity with the WordPress community and the GPL a plus, and experience organizing events or working as a project manager desired.

<p>Comfortable with PHP, JavaScript, and or HTML/CSS? We will be working on several community tool development initiatives this year, and would love to have Outreachy interns working on some of them. Possible projects include a new community hub, a status tracking app for our community programs, an email plugin to manage our support queue, a learning management plugin, a survey/forms plugin, and/or site and plugin revamps. Projects will be assigned based on relevant experience levels. For code projects, we are most interested in working with people already comfortable writing code and familiar with WordPress, as our mentors will be available to help with project direction as needed but will not be teaching classes in how to code.

<p>UX professionals encouraged to apply, to work on a grab bag of projects over the summer including but not limited to (designing and/or improving) a community hub, a status tracking app for our community programs, an email plugin to manage our support queue, a learning management plugin, and/or site redesigns.

<p>Video Transcription. The WordPress community has produced hundreds of hours of WordCamp presentations, tutorials, and other video content that needs to be transcribed for accessibility purposes. This project would basically be transcribing a set number of hours of our video content per week using open source tools. Good spelling and grammar required.

<p>Our mentors will come from the WordPress.org contributor teams, depending on which projects have successful applications. All mentors will have a minimum of 2 years experience working with the WordPress contributor teams. Each intern will be matched with a pair of mentors to ensure that there is enough support for both intern and mentors throughout the summer.

<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy#Application_Process">The application process</a> involves not only filling in an application, but making a volunteer contribution to the project to show that you are familiar with it and capable of doing the work should an internship be awarded. See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Outreachy_2016#Application_Contributions">the list of potential contributions</a> below for ideas, or contact a mentor to propose something that's not listed.
</p><p>Because our available projects span a wide range, we will host several Q&amp;A sessions in early March both in Slack an over video hangouts to allow potential applicants to ask questions and get a better idea of if WordPress would be a good fit.

<p>Most of those contributions are primarily PHP-based, but the actual projects may include <b>JavaScript</b> development as well. If you have JavaScript experience, please link to some of your pull requests, plugins, etc on your application, so that we can get an idea of your experience.
</p><p>Normally we encourage contributors to work together on tickets, but for Outreachy we need to evaluate each applicant on their own. So, once you've selected a ticket, please <b>leave a comment on it to indicate that you're working on it</b>. If another applicant is already working on a ticket, please choose a different one.
</p><p>For information on setting up a <b>local development environment</b>, submitting a patch, etc, please read our <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/first-steps/web-presence/contributing-to-wordcamp-org/">Contributing to WordCamp.org</a> guide. You can skip steps 1-3.
</p><p>If you submit <b>multiple contributions</b>, please pick ones that are different from each other (e.g., pick a Site Cloner ticket and a Tagregator ticket, rather than two Site Cloner tickets).
</p><p>Since the application deadline is approaching fast, please <b>ping <i>iandunn</i> on Slack once you've submitted a contribution</b>, so it can be reviewed quickly.

Its features were rolled into core and released with WordPress 3.0. You can simply proceed by <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress" title="Installing WordPress">Installing WordPress</a> and <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network" title="Create A Network">Create A Network</a> instead. It functions generally the same.</div>
<p>Not all WP plugins work with WPMU. See <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/WPMU_Plugin_Compatibility" title="WPMU Plugin Compatibility">WPMU Plugin Compatibility</a>. Plugin authors are working towards better compatibility.
</p><p>There are some special WPMU Plugins. See the official plugin repository and the WPMU tag. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/wpmu">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/wpmu</a> or <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/multisite">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/multisite</a>
</p><p>Please refer to each plugin's specific documentation. Plugins built specifically for WPMU may be required to be placed in the mu-plugins folder. 
</p><p>These plugins are usually designed to work sitewide or to be available to Site Admins only.

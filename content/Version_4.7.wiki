<blockquote>'''Note''': Twenty Seventeen only works on 4.7 and above. It uses the new video header and starter content features, each launched in 4.7.</blockquote>

;REST API Content Endpoints: API endpoints for WordPress content. WordPress 4.7 comes with REST API endpoints for posts, comments, terms, users, meta, and settings. Content endpoints provide machine-readable external access to your WordPress site with a clear, standards-driven interface, paving the way for new and innovative methods of interacting with your site. [https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/ Check out the REST API reference].

===The Finer Points===

;Theme Starter Content: Starter Content is the theme-specific selections of content to help showcase a theme to users and serve as a starting point for further setup of new sites. The initial view of a theme with starter content will only happen for "fresh sites" - new installs that have not yet had any posts, pages, widgets, or customizer settings updated ([https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/30/starter-content-for-themes-in-4-7/ read more]).

;Edit Shortcuts: Visible icons appear to show you which parts can be customized right there while live previewing. Click on a shortcut and get straight to editing, no decoding of widget area names or extra clicks needed. Paired with starter content, getting started with customizing your site is faster than ever ([https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/10/visible-edit-shortcuts-in-the-customizer-preview/ read more]).

;Video Headers: WordPress 4.7 extends the Custom Header feature to introduce support for video. Video headers play automatically, loop by default, and don't have sound. They work best when paired with an image, so they can progressively enhance the experience when video is supported ([https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/26/video-headers-in-4-7/ read more]).

;Smoother Nav Menu Building: Many primary navigation menus for sites contain links to the pages of your site. But what happens when you don't have any pages yet? Now you can add new pages while building nav menus instead of leaving the customizer and abandoning your changes. Once you've published your customizations, you'll have new pages ready for you to fill with content ([https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/06/16/feature-proposal-content-authorship-in-menus-with-live-preview/ read more]).

;Custom CSS: Sometimes you just need a few more visual tweaks to make your site perfect, or a plugin adds something that doesn't quite look right with your site. WordPress 4.7 allows you to instantly see changes while adding custom CSS to give your site that polish ([https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/11/feature-proposal-better-theme-customizations-via-custom-css-with-live-previews/ read more 1] and [https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/26/extending-the-custom-css-editor/ 2]).

;User Admin Languages and Locale Switching: Users can select their preferred locale (language) when editing their profile. The back end will be displayed in the user's individual locale while the locale used on the front end equals the one set for the whole site ([https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/07/user-admin-languages-and-locale-switching-in-4-7/ read more]).

;PDF Thumbnail Previews: Managing your document collection is easier with WordPress Version 4.7, which now shows preview thumbnails instead of a generic icon for PDFs in the media library ([https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/15/enhanced-pdf-support-4-7/ read more]).

===For Developers===

;Custom Bulk Actions: Simpler way to register bulk actions on list table screens ([https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/04/custom-bulk-actions/ read more]).

;Page Templates for Post Types: Add support for post type templates. By opening up the page template functionality to all post types, theme developers have even more flexibility with the WordPress template hierarchy ([https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/03/post-type-templates-in-4-7/ read more]).

;WP_Taxonomy: New <tt>WP_Taxonomy</tt> class provides methods to handle taxonomies. This changes the global <tt>$wp_taxonomies</tt> to an array of <tt>WP_Taxonomy</tt> objects ([https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/29/wp_taxonomy-in-4-7/ read more]).

;More Theme API Goodies: WordPress 4.7 includes new functions, hooks, and behavior for theme developers ([https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/09/09/new-functions-hooks-and-behaviour-for-theme-developers-in-wordpress-4-7/ read more])

;WP_Hook: The code that lies beneath actions and filters has been overhauled. You likely aren't affected, but if you've done things to the $wp_filter global or experienced funky recursion bugs in the past, please take a moment to read the dev note and test your code ([https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/09/08/wp_hook-next-generation-actions-and-filters/ read more])

;Customize Changesets: Browse your site and switch themes more seamlessly within the customizer, as your changes automatically persist in the background. Changesets also make exciting new features like starter content possible ([https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/12/customize-changesets-formerly-transactions-merge-proposal/ read more]).

;Attributes for Resource Hints: you're now able to pass specific HTML attributes to these resource hints to make even better use of them ([https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/03/attributes-for-resource-hints-in-4-7/ read more]).

;wp_list_sort() and WP_List_Util: WordPress 4.7 brings a few enhancements to handling object or array lists. A new function <tt>wp_list_sort()</tt> makes it easy to sort object or array lists by one or more of its elements' properties. A new <tt>WP_List_Util</tt> class was introduced as a central access point for handling lists ([https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/02/wp_list_sort-and-wp_list_util-in-4-7/ read more]).

==What's New==

===General===

;Editor Changes: Some of the toolbar buttons have been rearranged to make them easier to access and to encourage proper use of the HTML elements they insert ([https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/28/editor-changes-in-4-7/ read more]).
* The headings drop down is moved to the top row.
* The strike-through and horizontal rule button are moved down.
* The underline and justify buttons have been removed from the bottom row.

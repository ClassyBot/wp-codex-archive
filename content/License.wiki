==WordPress Licensing == 

Like most software, WordPress is distributed under a license, which means there are certain things that you are legally permitted (and not permitted) to do with WordPress software and source code. WordPress is distributed under a license called the [[GPL|GNU General Public License]], a very popular license in the open source industry. If that doesn't ring a bell, read on.

== About the GPL ==

The GNU General Public License, or GPL, is an open source license. Open source doesn't just mean that you can ''view'' the source code &mdash; it has political and philosophical implications as well. Open source, or "Free Software", means you are free to modify and redistribute the source code under certain conditions. ''Free'' doesn't refer to the price, it refers to freedom. The difference between the two meanings of ''free'' is often characterized as "Free as in speech'' vs. ''free as in beer."  The GPL is free as in speech.

== Why We Chose the GPL ==

The reasons for WordPress releasing under the GPL are both practical and idealistic. WordPress was born of the very freedom mentioned earlier. The predecessor to the WordPress project, b2/cafelog, was also an open source project.

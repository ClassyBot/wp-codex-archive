== What is it? ==

Since October 2007, every team translating WordPress can have their own local web site at a xx.wordpress.org subdomain.

The site is a WordPress install, which has four aims:
# to give brief information/description of WordPress
# to provide installation instructions
# to let the users download localized version of WordPress
# allows automatic upgrades to work with localized packages

These are accompanied by a blog, letting users follow the news about the translations.

== What it is not? ==

* A place for documentation. Although not perfect, use the Codex for now.

== How to get such a local site? ==

To request a new local site please read the [http://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/requesting-a-new-locale/ Requesting a New Locale] page on the Translator Handbook.

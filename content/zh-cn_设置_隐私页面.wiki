==设置 &rarr; 隐私==

“隐私”设置控制您站点对于搜索引擎（如 Google 和 Technorati 等）的可见性。您可决定是否让您的站点对所有人可见，包括 Google、Bing 和 Technorati 等。您可以拒绝搜索引擎访问您的网站，同时又允许一般的访客浏览您的站点。

;Site Visibility :

:*'''I would like my blog to be visible to everyone, including search engines (like Google, Bing, Technorati) and archivers''' -  Check this radio button so WordPress does not restrict search engines.

:*'''I would like to block search engines, but allow normal visitors''' - check this for these results:
::* Causes "<meta name='robots' content='noindex,nofollow' />" to be generated into the <head> </head> section (if wp_head is used) of your site's source, causing search engine spiders to ignore your site. 
::* Causes hits to robots.txt to send back:
:::User-agent: *
:::Disallow: /

::: '''Note:''' The above only works if WordPress is installed in the site root and no robots.txt exists.

::* Stops pings to ping-o-matic and any other RPC ping services specified in the [[Settings_Writing_Screen#Update_Services|Update Services]] of [[Administration_Screens|Administration]] > [[Administration_Screens#Writing|Settings]] > [[Settings_Writing_Screen|Writing]]. This works by having the function <tt>privacy_ping_filter()</tt> remove the sites to ping from the list. This filter is added by having <tt>add_filter('option_ping_sites','privacy_ping_filter');</tt> in the default-filters. When the <tt>generic_ping</tt> function attempts to get the "ping_sites" option, this filter blocks it from returning anything.

::*Hides the [[Settings_Writing_Screen#Update_Services|Update Services]] option entirely on the [[Administration_Screens|Administration]] > [[Administration_Screens#Writing|Settings]] > [[Settings_Writing_Screen|Writing]] Screen with the message "WordPress is not notifying any Update Services because of your blog's privacy settings."

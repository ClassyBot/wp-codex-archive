===上传多媒体文件===

Uploading media from your local computer into the Media Library is quite simple.  Two 'uploaders', Flash and Browser, are provided.  If the Flash uploader doesn't work, then click the "Browser Uploader" link to use the Broswer uploader.

====Flash 上传器====

;Choose files to upload: 
:*'''Select Files''' - Click this button, and then from the Select Files window, find and click the file to upload, then click the Open button.  A "Crunching..." message will display, and when the uploading is complete, the image and its related fields will be displayed.  At that point you may edit and save the information about that Media (see the [[#Edit Media|Edit Media section]] for more information).
:'''Uploading multiple files at once''' - After clicking the Select Files button, in the Select Files window, multiple files can be selected by holding down the '''Ctrl''' key and clicking on each file.  After all the files are seleted, click on the Open button and all of those files will be uploaded.  

:*'''Show''' and '''Hide''' - Once the Media is uploaded, a Show or Hide button is displayed to the right of the Media.  Clicking on Show will expand the Media and allow you to edit the Media information (see the [[#Edit Media|Edit Media section]]), and clicking on Hide will collapse the Media into a summary format.

====浏览器上传器====
Uploading via the Browser uploader:
:*'''Browse''' - Click this button, and then from the File Upload window, find and click the file to upload, then click the Open button.  The Media file name will be placed in the text box to the left of the Browse button.

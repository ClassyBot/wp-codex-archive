== Summary ==

From the [https://wordpress.org/news/2016/05/wordpress-4-5-2/ WordPress 4.5.2 release notes], WordPress versions 4.5.1 and earlier are affected by a SOME vulnerability through Plupload, the third-party library WordPress uses for uploading files. WordPress versions 4.2 through 4.5.1 are vulnerable to reflected XSS using specially crafted URIs through MediaElement.js, the third-party library used for media players. MediaElement.js and Plupload have also released updates fixing these issues.

Both issues were analyzed and reported by Mario Heiderich, Masato Kinugawa, and Filedescriptor from [https://cure53.de/ Cure53]. Thanks to the team for practicing [https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/ responsible disclosure], and to the Plupload and MediaElement.js teams for working closely with us to co√∂rdinate and fix these issues.

Over 6000 people became sick and 20 individuals lost their life in 1948 when a cloud of Air pollution blanketed the town of Donora(pennsylvania) for 5 days.
Donora had only total population of 14000 that can be translated to over 40% of the citizens suffered in same way - The industrial revolution brought progress and hope to many throughout the world but also presented adverse health impacts that realistically could non foreseen based on information available at the time - the event and many others like it made it clear there are impacts that needed careful consideration and studies in order to avoid them in the future - as such the Clean Air Acts was negotiated in 1963, - initial studies were completed which prompted the revision of the Clean Air Act in 1970 to incorporate Air Quality Standards

The goal was to prevent making Air Quality Worse as well as to reduce the frequency and the severity of existing pollution.

A total of six criteria Air pollutions were identified as indicator for Air Quality along with standard that set the maximum amounts of pollutants which could be released without creating worsening health or environmental condition.
These six pollutants become known as the Nation ambient air quality (NAAQS) and were divided in to primary and secondary standard.
Primary standard focus on the impact to human health and secondary standard focus on a broader environmental and community impacts.
And what are these six criteria impacts about? ....
The six criteria are as follow:
(a) carbon monoxide(co)
(b) nitrogen dioxide(Nox)
(c) Ozone,
(d) lead
(e) particulate matter
(f) sulfur dioxide(sox)

If an area exceeds the threshold established for the (NAAQS) then it's design as being non attainment area,
approximately, 75.5 million people at that time live in area more than in non attainment area.

What are the criteria pollutants?..
Carbon monoxide is an ordourless gas created from combustion or the process of burning material.
The first standard for (CO) Was established in approximately in 1971 and has been reviced over time to reflect new informations and technology. 

Nitrogen dioxide is a group of chemicals that create gases which are highly reactive, this mean that they help to create other chemicals or pollutants since it is a group of chemicals that has varied molecular structures, they are called (Nox) where the 'x' change to specific number depending on the specific chemical present, (e.g. Nitrogen dioxide is N02)
Nitrogen dioxide was chosen as an indicator for the present of NOxs,

Ozone is a natural occuring gas in the upper atmosphere, it becames a pollutants when it is found on the ground levels where it is created through chemical reaction, specifically the chemical reaction occurs between Nox and volatile organic compounds (vocs) when sunlight heat are presented, this pollutant predominantly is presented during the warmer summer month due to the reliance on sunlight in order for Ozone to be produced..

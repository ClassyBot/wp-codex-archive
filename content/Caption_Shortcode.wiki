The '''Caption''' feature allows you to wrap captions around content using a simple [[Shortcode]]. This is primarily used with individual images

 <tt>[caption]<image> Caption[/caption]</tt>

== Usage ==

Practical usage is like this:

 <tt>[caption id="attachment_6" align="alignright" width="300"]<img src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/800px-Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa2-300x205.jpg" alt="Kanagawa" title="The Great Wave" width="300" height="205" class="size-medium wp-image-6" /> The Great Wave[/caption]</tt>

Which looks like this:

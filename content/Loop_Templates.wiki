= Introduction =
Loop template files are used to format the loop based on what type of page you are visiting.

== What Template File is Used? == 

You can have loop templates for different loops. For example: loop-archive.php or loop-category.php which represent different loops for archives and categories, respectively.

= Examples =

You can call a loop from inside one of your page templates like this:
<pre>
<?php
 /* Run the loop to output the posts.
 * If you want to overload this in a child theme then include a file
 * called loop-index.php and that will be used instead.
 */
    get_template_part( 'loop', 'category' );
?>
</pre>

Using this method will call the file loop-category.php and run the content within in it.
Inside loop-category.php you might have code to format the loop just for category pages.

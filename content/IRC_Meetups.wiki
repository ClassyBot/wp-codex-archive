On some Thursdays at [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?hour=20&min=30&sec=0 20:30 UTC] we have an IRC "meetup" where everyone gets together in the [irc://irc.freenode.net/wordpress-dev #wordpress-dev] IRC channel to chat about the current release cycle.

Agenda and meeting summaries are posted on [http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/ wpdevel]. Whilst meetings are in progress, please help to stick to the agenda items by refraining from non-agenda chat until the meetings have completed.

Chat logs showing previous meets can be seen [https://irclogs.wordpress.org/ here].

You can find information about the WordPress irc channels [[IRC|here]].

== What Are Smileys? ==
Smileys, also known as "emoticons", are ''glyphs'' used to convey emotions in your writing. They are a great way to brighten up posts. [[Image:icon_smile.gif|smile emoticon]]

Text smileys are created by typing two or more punctuation marks. Some examples are:

<tt>;-)</tt> is equivalent to [[Image:icon_wink.gif|smile emoticon]]<br />
<tt>:-)</tt> is equivalent to [[Image:icon_smile.gif|smile emoticon]]<br />
<tt>:-(</tt> is equivalent to [[Image:icon_sad.gif|sad emoticon]]<br />
<tt>:-?</tt> is equivalent to [[Image:icon_confused.gif|confused emoticon]]<br />

To learn more about emoticons and their history, see the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticons Wikipedia entry on Emoticons].

===Smileys are not Emoji===
Although smileys and emoji can both display smiley faces and such, emoji are a newer development and have a much wider range of images that can be displayed. (They are also created differently.) For more information on emoji and how to use them, see the [[Emoji]] page.

== How Does WordPress Handle Smileys? ==
By default, WordPress automatically converts text smileys to graphic images. When you type <tt>;-)</tt> in your post you see [[Image:icon_wink.gif|smile emoticon]] when you preview or publish your post.

== To Turn off Graphic Smileys ==
As of WordPress 4.3, the option to disable graphic smileys was removed from new installs. There is [https://wordpress.org/plugins/keep-emoticons-as-text/ a plugin] if you want to retain the option.

== What Text Do I Type to Make Smileys? ==

== Troubleshooting Smileys ==

=== Why Doesn't it Work? ===
Smileys may have been disabled by your Wordpress admin. Another possibility is  the smiley image files have been deleted from <tt>/wp-includes/images/smilies</tt>.

=== Why Doesn't it Work for Me? ===
''If smileys work for others at your site but not for you:''

Type a space before and after your smiley text. That prevents the smiley being accidentally included in the text around it. [[Image:icon_redface.gif|redface emoticon]]

Make sure not to use quotes or other punctuation marks before and after the smiley text. [[Image:icon_rolleyes.gif|rolleyes emoticon]]

=== Where Are My Smiley Images Kept? ===
The smiley or emoticon image graphics are found in the <tt>/wp-includes/images/smilies</tt> directory.

Note that smileys is spelled 'eys' in this documentation and the directory name for the smiley images is '''smilies'', spelled 'ies'. [[Image:icon_eek.gif|eek emoticon]]

=== How Can I Have Different Smiley Images Appear? ===

The easiest way is to filter the smilies.

Upload the images you want with the same name to your server (say in wp-content/images/smilies) and put this in your theme's function.php:

<pre>
add_filter( 'smilies_src', 'my_custom_smilies_src', 10, 3 );
function my_custom_smilies_src( $img_src, $img, $siteurl )
{
    return $siteurl.'/wp-content/images/smilies/'.$img;
}
</pre>

That will replace http://example.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_question.gif with http://example.com/wp-content/images/smilies/icon_question.gif

=== Why are my Smiley Images Blank? ===
If you recently uploaded the images, it could be that the images have been uploaded in '''''ASCII''''' format by your FTP program. Re-upload the smileys ensuring that they are transferred in '''''BINARY''''' format. 

Some FTP programs have an '''auto-detect''' setting which will upload files in the correct format without user intervention. If you have such a setting, turn it on.

== Smiley CSS ==
The smiley images in WordPress are automatically given a [[Glossary#CSS|CSS]] class of '''wp-smiley''' when they are displayed in a post. You can use this class to style your smileys differently from other post images. 

For example, it's not uncommon to set up images in a post to appear on the left-hand side of the content with text flowing around the image. The CSS for that might look like this:

<pre>
.post img {
    float: left;
}
</pre> 

This would typically affect all images in a post, '''including''' your smiley images. To ''override'' this so that smileys stay inline, you could add this to your CSS:

<pre>
img.wp-smiley {
    float: none;
}
</pre>

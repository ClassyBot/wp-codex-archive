<p>Like most software, WordPress is distributed under a license, which means there are certain things that you are legally permitted (and not permitted) to do with WordPress software and source code. WordPress is distributed under a license called the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/GPL" title="GPL">GNU General Public License</a>, a very popular license in the open source industry. If that doesn't ring a bell, read on.
</p>

<p>The GNU General Public License, or GPL, is an open source license. Open source doesn't just mean that you can <i>view</i> the source code &#8212; it has political and philosophical implications as well. Open source, or "Free Software", means you are free to modify and redistribute the source code under certain conditions. <i>Free</i> doesn't refer to the price, it refers to freedom. The difference between the two meanings of <i>free</i> is often characterized as "Free as in speech<i> vs. </i>free as in beer."  The GPL is free as in speech.

<p>The reasons for WordPress releasing under the GPL are both practical and idealistic. WordPress was born of the very freedom mentioned earlier. The predecessor to the WordPress project, b2/cafelog, was also an open source project.

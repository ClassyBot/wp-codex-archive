This template is meant to be used for WordPress Version codex pages.

== Usage Example ==
<pre>
{{ Release
    | version = 4.3.1
    | date=16 Sept, 2015
    | status=[will be|was]
}}
</pre>

== Explanation of Variables ==

* Version is the version for this post
* Date is the date of the release
* Status is the status of the release. Please use 'will be' or 'was'.

In order to get the diff of files between versions, you will need to run this command:

  svn diff --summarize  http://core.svn.wordpress.org/tags/3.7.9/ http://core.svn.wordpress.org/tags/3.7.8/

With the first version being the new release and the second being the previous. Change versions for which page you're working on. Note that the tags aren't built for one or two hours ''after'' release, so you may have to wait on that data. Alternatively you can run this:

  svn diff --summarize http://core.svn.wordpress.org/branches/3.7/ http://core.svn.wordpress.org/tags/3.7.11/

In that diff, run the base release (3.7) against the previous one (3.7.11).

== Default Post ==

''(This can be copy/pasted into new versions)''

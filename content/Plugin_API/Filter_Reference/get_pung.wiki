==Description==
The <b>"get_pung"</b> filter is used to filter the list of URLs that have already been pinged for a post, after they have been retrieved from the database and before they are returned from the get_pung() function.

==Usage==

When the 'get_pung' filter is called, it is passed a single argument containing an array of URLs that have already been pinged. Functions attached to the filter can add or remove URLs from the array, then return the modified array.

<pre>
function filter_function_name( $pung ) {
  # ...
}
add_filter( 'get_pung', 'filter_function_name' );
</pre>

Where 'filter_function_name' is the function WordPress should call when the $pung array is being retrieved. Note that the filter function <b>must</b> return an array of URLs after it is finished processing, or any code using the $pung array will break, and other plugins also filtering the $pung array may generate errors.

'''filter_function_name''' should be unique function name. It cannot match any other function name already declared.

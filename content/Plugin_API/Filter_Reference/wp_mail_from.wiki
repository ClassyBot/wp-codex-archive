== Description == 

The <code>wp_mail_from</code> filter modifies the "from email address" used in an email sent using the [[Function_Reference/wp_mail|wp_mail]] function. When used together with the [[Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/wp_mail_from_name|'wp_mail_from_name']] filter, it creates a from address like "Name <email@address.com>". The filter should return an email address.

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$from_email|string|The "from" email address}}

== Examples ==
<code><pre>
add_filter( 'wp_mail_from', 'custom_wp_mail_from' );
function custom_wp_mail_from( $original_email_address ) {
	//Make sure the email is from the same domain 
	//as your website to avoid being marked as spam.
	return 'webmaster@mydomainname.com';
}
</pre></code>

It is not necessary to call another method if you can use anonymous functions (PHP 5.3.0+):

<code><pre>
add_filter( 'wp_mail_from', function( $email ) {
	return 'webmaster@mydomainname.com';
});
</pre></code>

== Notes ==
* To avoid your email being marked as spam, it is highly recommended that your "from" domain match your website.  
* Some hosts may require that your "from" address be a legitimate address.
* If you apply your filter using an anonymous function, you cannot remove it using <code>remove_filter()</code>.

== Description == 
The <tt>wp_mail</tt> filter hook allows you to filter the arguments that are passed to the <tt>wp_mail()</tt> function. The arguments for <tt>wp_mail()</tt> are passed through the filter as an array.

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$args|array|A compacted array of wp_mail() arguments, including the "to" email, subject, message, headers, and attachments values.|required|array()}}

== Examples ==
<pre>add_filter( 'wp_mail', 'my_wp_mail_filter' );
function my_wp_mail_filter( $args ) {
	
	$new_wp_mail = array(
		'to'          => $args['to'],
		'subject'     => $args['subject'],
		'message'     => $args['message'],
		'headers'     => $args['headers'],
		'attachments' => $args['attachments'],
	);
	
	return $new_wp_mail;
}</pre>

== Notes ==
$attachments should be an array. If it is not, it will be converted to one by the wp_mail function after the filter.

== Change Log ==
Since: [[Version 2.2]]

$attachments argument added in [[Version 2.7]]

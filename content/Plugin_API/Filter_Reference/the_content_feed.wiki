The "the_content_feed" filter is used to filter the content of the post after it is retrieved from the database and filtered by "[[Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/the_content|the_content]]" and before it is sent to RSS reader (or browser).

A plugin can register as a feed filter with the code: 

 <?php add_filter( "the_content_feed", "plugin_function_name" ) ?>

Example of filter function:

 /**
 * @param  $content Content of post
 * @return string
 */
 function plugin_function_name($content)
 {
    $content .= 'Total '.str_word_count($content).' words';
    return $content;
 }


'''NOTE:''' that the filter function the plugin defines '''must''' return the content after it is finished processing, or feed readers will see a blank item and other plugins also filtering the feed content may generate errors.

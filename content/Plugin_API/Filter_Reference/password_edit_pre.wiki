<pre>
function filter_function_name( $password, $post_id ) {
  // Process content here
  return $password;

</pre>

Where 'filter_function_name' is the function WordPress should call when filter is run. Note that the filter function <b>must</b> return a string after it is finished processing or the title will be empty.

'''filter_function_name''' should be unique function name. It cannot match any other function name already declared.

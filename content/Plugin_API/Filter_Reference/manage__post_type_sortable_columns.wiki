== Description ==
Filters the list table sortable columns for a specific screen.

== Parameters ==

{{Parameter|$sortable_columns|string|An array of sortable columns.}}
== Examples ==

As an example. When you see the table with the posts in the admin screen, you can sort the posts by title. If you wanted to remove the ability to sort by the title you could do the following:

The screen ID for the posts overview page in the admin is edit-post, so the filter would be “manage_edit-post_sortable_columns”.
<code><pre>add_filter( 'manage_edit-post_sortable_columns', 'slug_title_not_sortable' );
function slug_title_not_sortable( $cols ) {
    unset( $cols['title'] );
    return $cols;
}</pre></code>

==Description==
This hook allows you to change the directory where files are uploaded to. The keys and values in the array are used by the <tt>wp_upload_dir</tt> function in wordpress core, which is doing the work.

==Examples==
This goes into your plugin.

<pre>
add_filter('upload_dir', 'awesome_wallpaper_dir');

function awesome_wallpaper_dir( $param ){
    $mydir = '/awesome';

    $param['path'] = $param['path'] . $mydir;
    $param['url'] = $param['url'] . $mydir;

    return $param;
}
</pre>

If your plugin is written as a class, you'll want to hook to it like so:
<pre>
add_filter( 'upload_dir', array( $this, 'awesome_wallpaper_dir' ) );
</pre>


Using this, in conjunction with the wp_handle_upload_prefilter, you can dynamically determine which directory to upload to, based on the files you upload.

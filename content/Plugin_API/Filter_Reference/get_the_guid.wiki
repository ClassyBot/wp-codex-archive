==Description==
The <b>"get_the_guid"</b> filter is used to filter the guid of the post after it is retrieved from the database and before it is returned from the get_the_guid() function.

==Usage==

When the 'get_the_guid' filter is called, it is passed a single argument containing the post guid.  

<pre>
function filter_function_name( $guid ) {
  # ...
}
add_filter( 'get_the_guid', 'filter_function_name' );
</pre>

Where 'filter_function_name' is the function WordPress should call when the guid is being retrieved. Note that the filter function <b>must</b> return the guid after it is finished processing, or any code using the guid (for example: RSS feeds) will break, and other plugins also filtering the guid may generate errors.

'''filter_function_name''' should be unique function name. It cannot match any other function name already declared.

==Description==
This [[Plugin API/Filter Reference|filter hook]] allows developers to adjust the number of posts that WordPress's [[Class Reference/WP_Query|WP_Query]] class reports finding when it runs a query.

This hook is especially useful when developing [[Making_Custom_Queries_using_Offset_and_Pagination|custom pagination]]. For instance, if you are declaring a custom offset value in your queries, WordPress will NOT deduct the offset from the the <tt>$wp_query->found_posts</tt> parameter (for example, if you have 45 usable posts after an offset of 10, WordPress will ignore the offset and still give <tt>found_posts</tt> a value of 55).

Make sure you haven't passed <tt>no_found_rows</tt> in query arguments, Otherwise you will receive a 0 value in return.

The <tt>lostpassword_redirect</tt> filter is used to change the location redirected to after a user requests a password reset. This could be the location set by the "redirect_to" parameter sent to the forgot password page.

== Parameters ==

{{Parameter|$lostpassword_redirect|string|The redirect destination URL.}}

== Examples ==

This simple example will redirect a user to the home_url() upon successful password reset.
<pre>
add_filter( 'lostpassword_redirect', 'my_redirect_home' );
function my_redirect_home( $lostpassword_redirect ) {
	return home_url();
}
</pre>

== Notes ==

This filter is to redirect the user following reset of the password. To filter the location of the password reset itself, use <tt>[[Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/lostpassword_url|lostpassword_url]]</tt>

== Description ==

This filter is used by [[Function Reference/wp trim excerpt|wp_trim_excerpt()]] function.  By default the excerpt length is set to return 55 words.

== Examples ==

To change excerpt length, add the following code to <tt>functions.php</tt> file in your theme adjusting the "20" to match the number of words you wish to display in the excerpt:

 function custom_excerpt_length( $length ) {
 	return 20;
 }
 add_filter( 'excerpt_length', 'custom_excerpt_length', 999 );

Make sure to set the priority correctly, such as 999, else the default WordPress filter on this function will run last and override what you set here.

== Change Log ==

* Since: [[Version 2.8|2.8.0]]

== Source File ==

<tt>wp_trim_excerpt()</tt> is located in {{Trac|wp-includes/formatting.php}}.

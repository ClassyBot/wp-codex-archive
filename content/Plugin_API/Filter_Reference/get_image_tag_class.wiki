== Description ==

This filter allows you to edit the classes that are automatically applied to images that are inserted into the TinyMCE editor via the Add Media button.

function my_image_class_filter($classes) {
	return $classes . ' another-image-class';
}
add_filter('get_image_tag_class', 'my_image_class_filter');
</pre>

<p>As at version 2.7 the_content_rss cannot be relied upon as it does not apply to all feeds.  There are bugs open for this filter which may result in it being sorted in later versions.
</p><p>Meanwhile, you can apply your filter to the_content and check for is_feed() to achieve the result you are looking for.
</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> This still seems to apply for 3.0. However, from version 2.9 upwards you should use the new filter <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/the_content_feed" title="Plugin API/Filter Reference/the content feed">the_content_feed</a> is in place (there is some documentation about it, but it's not complete). You can use this filter instead.

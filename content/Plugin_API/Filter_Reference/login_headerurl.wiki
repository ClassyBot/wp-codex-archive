The <b>"login_headerurl"</b> filter is used to filter the url of the logo in WordPress login page. By default this logo links to WordPress site.

A plugin can register as a content filter with the code:

<code>add_filter("login_headerurl","plugin_function_name");</code>

Where "plugin_function_name" is the function WordPress should call when the content is being retrieved. Note that the filter function the plugin defines <b>must</b> return the url after it is finished processing, or the logo may not have any links and other plugins also filtering the same may generate errors.

You can also use this in the theme function.php file within your WordPress page if you don't wish to use a plugin or want to distribute your theme.

=== Example === 

In the below example the logo's default link is changed to the site url.

<pre>
function the_url( $url ) {
    return get_bloginfo( 'url' );
}
add_filter( 'login_headerurl', 'the_url' );
</pre>

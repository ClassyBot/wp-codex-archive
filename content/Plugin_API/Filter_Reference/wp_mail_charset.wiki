== Description == 
The default character encoding for <tt>wp_mail()</tt> is UTF-8. The character encoding can be changed using the <tt>wp_mail_charset</tt> filter.

While the average user is unlikely to need to change the default character encoding for email, users who need to send email in different languages may find this filter useful.

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$charset|string|The email character encoding|required|UTF-8}}

== Examples ==
The following will filter the character encoding to UTF-32
<pre>
add_filter( 'wp_mail_charset', 'change_mail_charset' );
function change_mail_charset( $charset ) {
	return 'UTF-32';
}
</pre>
== Notes ==
As of [[Version 3.5]], WordPress character encoding is no longer configurable from the Administration Panel and defaults to UTF-8.

== Change Log ==
Since: [[Version 2.3]]

== Source File ==
<code>wp_mail_charset</code> is located in {{Trac|wp-includes/pluggable.php}}

== Description ==
The *widget_meta_poweredby* filter is part of the build in **Meta** widget. This filter allows you to alter the powered by link at the bottom of the widget. By default this links to WordPress.org.

== Usage ==

When the 'widget_meta_poweredby' filter is called, it is passed once parameters: the list item containing the powered by link.

<pre>
function filter_function_name( $link ) {
  // Do link manipulation here
  return $link;
}
add_filter( 'widget_meta_poweredby', 'filter_function_name', 10 );
</pre>

Where 'filter_function_name' is the function WordPress should call when filter is run. Note that the filter function <b>must</b> return an value after it is finished processing or the result will be empty.

'''filter_function_name''' should be unique function name. It cannot match any other function name already declared.

== Examples ==

=== Replacing with a custom powered by link ===
<pre>
add_filter( 'widget_meta_poweredby', 'func' );

function func( $p1 ) {
    // Replace with custom powered by link
    return ' More Awesome by <a href="http://ma.tt" title="More Awesome by Matt Mullenweg">Matt Mullenweg</a>';
}
</pre>

==Description==
When you upload Media from your WordPress admin dashboard, <tt>wp_handle_upload</tt> is called once for each file the user specified. <tt>wp_handle_upload_prefilter</tt> is an admin filter that is called by the <tt>wp_handle_upload</tt> function. The single parameter, <tt>$file</tt>, represent a single element of the <tt>$_FILES</tt> array. The <tt>wp_handle_upload_prefilter</tt> provides you with an opportunity to examine or alter the filename before the file is moved to its final location.

==Examples==

<pre>
add_filter('wp_handle_upload_prefilter', 'custom_upload_filter' );

function custom_upload_filter( $file ){
    $file['name'] = 'wordpress-is-awesome-' . $file['name'];
    return $file;
}
</pre>

Using this, in conjunction with the upload_dir, you can dynamically determine which directory to upload to, based on the files you upload.

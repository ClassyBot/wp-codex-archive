This article on the Plugin Hooks available in Version 2.1 of WordPress has now been split into two sections:
* [[Plugin API/Filter Reference]] - reference list of all of the Filter Hooks in WordPress
* [[Plugin API/Action Reference]] - reference list of all of the Action Hooks in WordPress

To learn more about what Filter and Action Hooks are, see [[Plugin API]]. For information about hooks in previous versions of WordPress, see [[Plugin API/Hooks 2.0.x]].

== Notes ==
The reason for the aforementioned split is because Hooks <b>are</b> Actions and Filters. In fact, proper grammar would say "Actions and Filters can be Hooked."

=== Terminology ===
In WordPress Codex and source code, the terms "[http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Action actions]/[http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Filter filters]" and "[http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Hook hooks]" are sometime used ambiguously. See the [http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Terminology_Confusion Terminology Confusion] note for clarity.

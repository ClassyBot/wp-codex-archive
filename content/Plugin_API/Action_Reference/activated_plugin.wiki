==Description==
This hook is run immediately after any plugin is activated, and may be used to detect the activation of plugins.

If a plugin is silently activated (such as during an update), this hook does not fire.

==Example==
<pre>function detect_plugin_activation( $plugin, $network_activation ) {
    // do stuff
}
add_action( 'activated_plugin', 'detect_plugin_activation', 10, 2 );</pre>

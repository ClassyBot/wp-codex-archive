== Examples ==

The following example allows you to do something immediately after a comment is posted. In this case we are checking whether the comment is approved before adding our function logic. 

<pre>
add_action( 'comment_post', 'show_message_function', 10, 2 );
function show_message_function( $comment_ID, $comment_approved ) {
	if( 1 === $comment_approved ){
		//function logic goes here
	}
}
</pre>

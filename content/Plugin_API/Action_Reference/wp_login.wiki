==Description==

The '''<tt>wp_login</tt> action hook''' is triggered when a user logs in by the [[Function Reference/wp_signon|<tt>wp_signon()</tt> function]]. It is the very last action taken in the function, immediately following the wp_set_auth_cookie() call. 

This hook is an action which means that it primarily acts as an event trigger, instead of a content filter. This is a semantic difference, but it will help you to remember what this hook does if you use it like this:

<pre>
<?php
function your_function() {
    // your code
}
add_action('wp_login', 'your_function');
?>
</pre>

This hook provides access to two parameters: $user->user_login (string) and $user ( [[Class_Reference/WP_User|WP_User]] ). To pass them into your function you will need to add a priority (default is 10) and request 2 arguments from the [[Function_Reference/add_action|add_action()]] call:

<pre>
<?php
function your_function( $user_login, $user ) {
    // your code
}
add_action('wp_login', 'your_function', 10, 2);
?>
</pre>

See [[Plugin API#Actions|Plugin API - Actions]] for more detail.

==Description==

The <tt>deleted_user</tt> action/hook can be used to perform additional actions after a user is deleted. For example, you can delete rows from custom tables created by a plugin.

The hook passes one parameter: the user's ID.

This hook runs after a user is deleted. The hook <tt>delete_user</tt> (delete vs deleted) runs before a user is deleted. Choose the appropriate hook for your needs. If you need access to user meta or fields from the user table, use <tt>delete_user</tt>.

==Usage==
<pre><?php add_action( 'deleted_user', 'function_name' ); ?></pre>

where "function_name" is the name of the function to be called.

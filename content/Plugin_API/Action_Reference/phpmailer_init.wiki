== Description == 
The <tt>[[Function_Reference/wp_mail|wp_mail]]</tt> function relies on the [https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/ PHPMailer] class to send email through PHP's <tt>mail</tt> function.  The phpmailer_init action hook allows you to hook to the phpmailer object and pass in your own arguments.

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|&$phpmailer|array|The PHPMailer instance, passed by reference.|required|array()}}

== Examples ==
This is an example of establishing an SMTP connection using the `phpmailer_init` action:
<pre>
add_action( 'phpmailer_init', 'my_phpmailer_example' );
function my_phpmailer_example( $phpmailer ) {
    $phpmailer->isSMTP();     
    $phpmailer->Host = 'smtp.example.com';
    $phpmailer->SMTPAuth = true; // Force it to use Username and Password to authenticate
    $phpmailer->Port = 25;
    $phpmailer->Username = 'yourusername';
    $phpmailer->Password = 'yourpassword';

    // Additional settingsâ€¦
    //$phpmailer->SMTPSecure = "tls"; // Choose SSL or TLS, if necessary for your server
    //$phpmailer->From = "you@yourdomail.com";
    //$phpmailer->FromName = "Your Name";
}
</pre>

== Notes ==
This action is initiated with `do_action_ref_array` rather than `do_action`.  You still hook to it with `do_action`.  However, there are some notable differences:
* If you pass an array to `do_action_ref_array()`, each element's value of that array is passed as a separate parameter to the callback.
* If you pass an array to `do_action()`, the complete array is passed as a single argument including any keys.

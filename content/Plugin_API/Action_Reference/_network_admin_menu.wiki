This action could be used to modify the menu in the [[Glossary#Network|network]] admin panel. It runs before the basic network admin panel menu structure is complete. It is more usual to use the [[Plugin_API/Action_Reference/network_admin_menu|network_admin_menu]] action to modify the menu after it is complete.

== Usage ==

<pre><?php add_action('_network_admin_menu', 'function_name'); ?></pre>

where "function_name" is the name of the function to be called.

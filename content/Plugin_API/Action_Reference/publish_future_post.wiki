== Description ==
publish_future_post is an action triggered when a post is transitioned from 'future' to 'publish' status (see [[Post Status Transitions]])

== Example ==
<pre>
add_action( 'publish_future_post', 'my_test_future_post' );

function my_test_future_post( $post_id ) {
	update_post_meta( $post_id, 'hook_fired', 'true' );
}
</pre>

== Notes/Reference ==
Important: As the links below explain, the action sends in the post_id of the post that transitioned from future to published so you can act on it. Your hook function must declare the parameter (e.g. $post_id).

}}

== Description ==
Fires after WordPress has finished loading but before any headers are sent.

Most of WP is loaded at this stage, and the user is authenticated. WP continues to load on the init hook that follows (e.g. widgets), and many plugins instantiate themselves on it for all sorts of reasons (e.g. they need a user, a taxonomy, etc.).

== Examples ==
Use <tt>init</tt> to act on $_POST data:
<pre>add_action( 'init', 'process_post' );

function process_post() {
     if( isset( $_POST['unique_hidden_field'] ) ) {
          // process $_POST data here
     }
}
</pre>

== Notes ==

<tt>init</tt> is useful for intercepting $_GET or $_POST triggers.

[[Function_Reference/load_plugin_textdomain|<tt>load_plugin_textdomain</tt>]] calls should be made during <tt>init</tt>, otherwise users cannot hook into it.

If you wish to plug an action once WP is loaded, use the [[Plugin_API/Action_Reference/wp_loaded|<tt>wp_loaded</tt>]] hook.

== Change Log ==

Since: [[Version 1.5|1.5]]

== Source File ==

The <tt>init</tt> action is located in {{Trac|wp-settings.php}}

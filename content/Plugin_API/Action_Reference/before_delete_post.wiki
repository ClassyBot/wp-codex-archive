[[Category:Actions]]

== Example ==
Let's suppose you have a plugin and when a certain <b>post_type</b> is deleted you want to perform some action.

%%% <?php
add_action( 'before_delete_post', 'my_func' );
function my_func( $postid ){

    // We check if the global post type isn't ours and just return
    global $post_type;   
    if ( $post_type != 'my_custom_post_type' ) return;

    // My custom stuff for deleting my custom post type here
}
?>%%%

== Note == 
It's important to note the hook runs '''only''' when the WordPress user '''empties the Trash'''.
If you're using this hook note that it will ''not'' fire if the user is deleting an Attachment, since attachments are ''force deleted'', i.e., not sent to the Trash. Instead use the [[Plugin_API/Action_Reference/delete_post|delete_post()]] hook.

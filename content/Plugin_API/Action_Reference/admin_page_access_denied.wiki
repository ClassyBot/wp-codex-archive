== Description ==
<tt>admin_page_access_denied</tt> is an action hook triggered when a user does not have permission to access a page in the control panel. This is most likely due to not having the required [[Roles_and_Capabilities|capability]] to access the page.

The action hook is fired before <tt>[[Function_Reference/wp_die|wp_die]]</tt> is executed, and is a result of the function <tt>[[Function_Reference/user_can_access_admin_page|user_can_access_admin_page]]</tt> returning false.

== Parameters ==

There are no arguments passed to this hook.

== Usage ==

<pre><?php add_action( 'admin_page_access_denied', 'callback' ); ?></pre>

Where "callback" is the name of a function, or method, to be executed.

== Examples ==

<pre><?php
add_action( 'admin_page_access_denied', 'my_plugin_log_permission_error');

function my_plugin_log_permission_error() {
    // your code here
}
?></pre>

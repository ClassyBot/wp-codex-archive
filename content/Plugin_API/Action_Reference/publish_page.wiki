==Description==

<tt>publish_page</tt> is an action triggered whenever a page is published, or if it is edited and the status is changed to publish.

'''This action hook is not depreciated!'''

Previously, on both this page and the [[Plugin_API/Action_Reference|Action Reference]] page, <tt>publish_page</tt> had been identified as depreciated since [[Version 2.3|WordPress 2.3]]. That was incorrect. Since Version 2.3, <tt>publish_page</tt> is an action that adheres to the new form of post status transition actions <tt>{status}_{post_type}</tt>. For more information, see [[Post Status Transitions]].

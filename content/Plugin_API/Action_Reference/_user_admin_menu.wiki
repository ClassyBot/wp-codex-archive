This action could be used to modify the menu in the user admin panel. It runs before the basic user admin panel menu structure is complete. It is more usual to use the [[Plugin_API/Action_Reference/admin_menu|admin_menu]] action to modify the menu after it is complete.

== Usage ==

<pre><?php add_action('_user_admin_menu', 'function_name'); ?></pre>

where "function_name" is the name of the function to be called.

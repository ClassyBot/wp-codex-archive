==Description==
This hook is called when an attachment is deleted by [[Function_Reference/wp_delete_attachment|wp_delete_attachment()]] in <tt>wp-includes/post.php</tt>.

Up to and including WordPress 2.7 it is fired ''after'' the attachment is deleted from the database and the file system, limiting its usefulness. As of [http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/10400 changeset #10400] (WordPress 2.8), the action will fire ''before'' anything is deleted.

==Parameters==
{{Parameter|$postid|integer|The ID of the attachment being deleted.}}

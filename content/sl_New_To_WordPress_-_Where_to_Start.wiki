==Korak Ena - Preberi==

Preden boste vlagali svoj dragoceni čas in energijo z namestitvijo WordPressa, obstaja nekaj člankov, ki jih boste morali prebrati. WordPress je izjemen produkt; lahek za uporabito, zelo močan, ampak to še ne pomeni da je pravi za čisto vse. Tako kot izgradnja hiše morate tudi tukaj uporabiti pravo orodje za pravo delo. Razmislite o [[Creating a PDF of a Codex Article|ustvarjanju PDF-ja]] in ga preberite.

* [[WordPress| Kaj je WordPress?]]
* [[WordPress Features]]
* [[sl:Before You Install|Preden Namestite WordPress]]

==Korak Dva - Naredite Načrt==

Based upon the information you've just read, including instructions on installing WordPress, you should have a list of the things you need, and the things you need to do.  If not, make that list now--you'll want to make sure it includes the following information:

* [[Hosting_WordPress|Website Host Requirements Checked and Verified]]

* [[Core_Update_Host_Compatibility|Web Host Compatibility with New Versions of WordPress]]

It is important to make a plan about how you want to use WordPress on your site.  Here are some questions to ask yourself.  Make a list of the answers so you can add to your plan.

* Will you install WordPress in the root directory, subdirectory, or you just want to make a test site to make sure you want to use it?
* Have you made a list of your site [[Glossary#C|Categories]]? Understand that WordPress can only order Categories alphabetically by name or by ID (order entered through the [[Administration_Panels#Manage - Change your content|Manage]] > [[Administration_Panels#Categories|Categories]] screen), so if the display order of your Categories is important to you, start making your list of Categories. 
* Have you made a list of [[Pages]] you may want to add to your site, such as '''About''', '''Contact''', or '''Events'''?

==Step Three - Install WordPress==

As you change various settings, it is recommended you view how those changes impact your site by frequently clicking the <tt>View Site</tt> link at the top of the [[Administration_Panels|Administration]] Screen.

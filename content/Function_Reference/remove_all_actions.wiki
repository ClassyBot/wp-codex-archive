== Description ==
Remove all of the hooks from an action. 

== Usage ==
%%%<?php remove_all_actions( $tag, $priority ) ?>%%%

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$tag|string|The action to remove hooks from.}}
{{Parameter|$priority|integer|The priority number to remove them from.|optional|false}}

== Return Values ==
; (boolean) : True when finished.

== Examples ==
<!-- Need creative examples. Feel free to link to external examples. -->

== Notes ==
You can't call this function from within the hook you would like to remove actions from. For example adding an action to wp_footer that calls <tt>remove_all_actions('wp_footer')</tt> will cause an infinite loop condition because the while loop suddenly doesn't have a next value. In WordPress 3.8.1 you'll get a warning message like: 
<code>
Warning: next() expects parameter 1 to be array, null given in wp-includes/plugin.php on line 431
</code>

You'll just need to hook into a hook that's called before the hook you wish to clear is called.

== Change Log ==
Since: 2.7

== Source File ==
<tt>remove_all_actions()</tt> is located in {{Trac|wp-includes/plugin.php}}.

== Description ==
Strips slashes from in front of quotes.

This function changes the character sequence <tt>\"</tt>  to just <tt>"</tt>. It leaves all other slashes alone. It's really weird, but the quoting from preg_replace(//e) seems to require this.

== Usage ==
%%%<?php wp_kses_stripslashes( $string ) ?>%%%

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$string|string|String to strip slashes}}

== Return Values ==
; (string) : Fixed strings with quoted slashes

== Examples ==
<!-- Need creative examples. Feel free to link to external examples. -->

== Notes ==

== Change Log ==
Since: 1.0.0

== Source File ==

<tt>wp_kses_stripslashes()</tt> is located in <tt>{{Trac|wp-includes/kses.php}}</tt>.

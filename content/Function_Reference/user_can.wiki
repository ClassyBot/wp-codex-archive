== Description ==

Whether a user has capability or role. Similar to [[Function_Reference/current_user_can|current_user_can()]], but this function takes a user ID or object as its first parameter.

While checking against particular roles in place of a capability is supported in part, this practice is discouraged as it may produce unreliable results.

== Usage ==

%%% <?php user_can( $user, $capability ); ?> %%%

== Parameters ==

{{Parameter|$user|object or integer (ID)|required}}
{{Parameter|$capability|string|[[Roles and Capabilities|capability]] or role name.|required}}

== Returns ==
; (boolean) : user has capability or role.

== Changelog ==

== Description ==

Retrieve translated string with gettext context

Quite a few times, there will be collisions with similar translatable text found in more than two places but with different translated context.

By including the context in the pot file translators can translate the two strings differently.

== Usage ==

%%%<?php $translated_text = _x( $text, $context, $domain ) ?>%%%

== Parameters ==

{{Parameter|$text|string|Text to translate}}
{{Parameter|$context|string|Context information for the translators}}
{{Parameter|$domain|string|Domain to retrieve the translated text|optional|'default'}}

== Return Values ==

; (string) : Translated context string.

== Examples ==

<pre>
$translated = _x( 'Read', 'past participle: books I have read' );
</pre>

Since the string <tt>'Read'</tt> on its own could have one of several different meanings in English, context is given so that translators know that they should be supplying a short term that means "Books I have read."

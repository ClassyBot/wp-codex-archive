== Description ==

Sanitizes a html classname to ensure it only contains valid characters.

Strips the string down to A-Z,a-z,0-9,_,-. If this results in an empty string, then the function will return the alternative value supplied. After <code>sanitize_html_class()</code> has done its work, it passes the sanitized class name through the [[Plugin API/Filter Reference/sanitize_html_class|sanitize_html_class]] filter.

== Parameters ==

{{Parameter|$class|string|The classname to be sanitized.}}
{{Parameter|$fallback|string|The value to return if the sanitization ends up as an empty string. Defaults to an empty string.|optional}}

== Return Values ==
{{Return|string|string|The sanitized value.}}

== Examples ==

<pre>
<?php
// If you want to explicitly style a post, you can use the sanitized version of the post title as a class
$post_class = sanitize_html_class( $post->post_title );
echo '<div class="' . $post_class . '">';
</pre>

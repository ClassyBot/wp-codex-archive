{{#dotorgredirect:https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/popuplinks/}}

== Description ==
Adds <tt> target='_blank' and rel='external'</tt> to all HTML <tt>Anchor</tt> tags to open links in new windows. 

Comment text in popup windows should be filtered through this. Right now it's a moderately dumb function, ideally it would detect whether a target or rel attribute was already there and adjust its actions accordingly. 

== Usage ==
%%%<?php popuplinks( $text ) ?>%%%

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$text|string|Content to replace links to open in a new window.}}

== Return Values ==
; (string) : Content that has filtered links.

== Examples ==
=== Default usage===
<pre>
<?php
echo popuplinks('Please visit <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a>.');
?>
</pre>
Will output:
<pre>
Please visit <a href="http://www.wordpress.com" target='_blank' rel='external'>WordPress.com</a>
</pre>

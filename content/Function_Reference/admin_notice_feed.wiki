{{Deprecated}}

This function is not defined on any WordPress core file as of v3.1 and should therefore be considered deprecated. It was added with the integration of WPMU with WordPress core in version 3.0, but was not used in any core files, so was removed in 3.1.

== Change Log ==
* Removed [[Version_3.1|3.1.0]]
* Since [[Version MU|MU]] ([[Version 3.0|3.0.0]])

== Source File ==

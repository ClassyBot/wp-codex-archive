}}

== Description ==

Whether current user has a specific capability.

While checking against particular roles in place of a capability is supported in part, this practice is discouraged as it may produce unreliable results.
== Usage ==

%%% <?php current_user_can( $capability , $object_id ); ?> %%%

== Parameters ==

{{Parameter|$capability|string|[[https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/ Role or capability]].|required}}
{{Parameter|$object_id|int|Recommended when checking meta capabilities such as the capabilities defined in the [https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/map_meta_cap `map_meta_cap`] function i.e 'edit_post', 'edit_others_posts', 'read_post' etc. If omitted you may receive an 'Undefined offset: 0' warning (this is because the [https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/current_user_can `current_user_can`] function eventually calls  [https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/map_meta_cap `map_meta_cap`] which when checking against meta capabilities expects an array but is only supplied a single value) |optional}}

== Returns ==
; (boolean) : current user has capability.

== Notes ==
For additional information on the 'undefined index 0' warning please see this [http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/83514/undefined-offset-0-in-wp-includes-capabilities-php-on-line-1067 detailed response on the WordPress Stack Exchange].

current_user_can( $capability ) will aways return true if user is Super Admin, unless specifically denied - see inline source code on [http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_user/has_cap/ https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_user/has_cap/]

Passing role names to <tt>current_user_can()</tt> is discouraged as this is not guaranteed to work correctly (see [http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22624 #22624]).

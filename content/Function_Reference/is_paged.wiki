==Description==
This [[Conditional Tags|Conditional Tag]] checks if page being displayed is "paged" and the current page number is greater than one. This is a boolean function, meaning it returns either TRUE or FALSE.

'''Note''': This refers to an archive or the main page being split up over several pages, this does '''not''' refer to a Post or [[Pages|Page]] whose content has been divided into pages using the <tt><!<nowiki></nowiki>--nextpage--></tt> [[Write Post SubPanel#Quicktags|QuickTag]].

==Usage==
%%%<?php is_paged(); ?>%%%

==Parameters==

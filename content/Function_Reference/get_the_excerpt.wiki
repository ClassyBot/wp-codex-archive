== Description ==

Returns the excerpt of the post. This is either a user-supplied excerpt, that is returned unchanged, or an automatically generated word-counted trimmed-down version of the full post content.

The auto-generated excerpts have all shortcodes and tags removed which means it is just an unformatted string that would not see any line-breaks in any form of output, since the actual line-breaks in the raw text are also removed.

When called through [[Function Reference/the_excerpt|the_excerpt()]] this implies that the auto-gen excerpts are just raw text with <tt>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</tt> tags wrapped around it, basically.

Auto-gen excerpts have a "more" tag appended to them. This tag is '<tt>[&hellip;]</tt>' by default. It can be changed through the [[Plugin API/Filter Reference/excerpt_more|excerpt_more]] filter.

The default word length is 55 words. It can be changed through the [[Plugin API/Filter Reference/excerpt_length|excerpt_length]] filter.

== Usage ==
%%% <?php $excerpt = get_the_excerpt( int|WP_Post $post ) ?> %%%

This function must be used within [[The Loop]] when no <code>$post</code> or ID parameter is passed.

If this function is used outside The Loop and the post doesn't have a custom excerpt, this function will use [[Function Reference/wp_trim_excerpt|wp_trim_excerpt()]] to generate an excerpt. That function uses [[Function Reference/get_the_content|get_the_content()]], which must be used with The Loop and will cause problems if get_the_excerpt() is being used outside The Loop. In order to avoid the issues, use [[Function Reference/setup_postdata|setup_postdata()]] prior to calling get_the_excerpt() to set up the global $post object.

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$post|integer&#124;WP_Post|Post ID or [[Class_Reference/WP_Post|WP_Post]] object. Default is global <code>$post</code>.|optional|null}}

== Return Values ==

* Returns an existing excerpt unchanged (by default) but applies [[Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/get_the_excerpt|get_the_excerpt]] filters to it.
* Returns a trimmed-down version of the full post content as described, additionally applying [[Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/wp_trim_excerpt|wp_trim_excerpt]] filters to it. <tt>'wp_trim_excerpt'</tt> is chained from <tt>'get_the_excerpt'</tt>, meaning that your own <tt>get_the_excerpt</tt> filter will get called before or after the trim depending on the priority of your filter. If called before, your <tt>$text</tt> parameter will be an empty string if there is no user supplied excerpt, whereas it will be the trimmed-down version of the full post if called after. In the latter case it might be useful or more meaningful to use <tt>'wp_trim_excerpt'</tt> since it has a second parameter giving you the untrimmed input to the [[Function_Reference/wp_trim_excerpt|wp_trim_excerpt]] function, meaning this second parameter is simply the raw <tt>$post->post_excerpt</tt>.
* For password protected pages it returns a string, which has a default value of "''There is no excerpt because this is a protected post.''" This text can be changed in the function definition.

== Examples ==

'''get_the_excerpt()''' can be used to retrieve and store the value in a variable, without outputting it to the page.

<pre><nowiki><?php
$my_excerpt = get_the_excerpt();
if ( '' != $my_excerpt ) {
	// Some string manipulation performed
}
echo $my_excerpt; // Outputs the processed value to the page
?></nowiki></pre>

Use '''get_the_excerpt()''' to print an excerpt by specifying a maximium number of characters.

<pre><nowiki><?php
the_excerpt_max_charlength(140);

function the_excerpt_max_charlength($charlength) {
	$excerpt = get_the_excerpt();
	$charlength++;

	if ( mb_strlen( $excerpt ) > $charlength ) {
		$subex = mb_substr( $excerpt, 0, $charlength - 5 );
		$exwords = explode( ' ', $subex );
		$excut = - ( mb_strlen( $exwords[ count( $exwords ) - 1 ] ) );
		if ( $excut < 0 ) {
			echo mb_substr( $subex, 0, $excut );
		} else {
			echo $subex;
		}
		echo '[...]';
	} else {
		echo $excerpt;
	}
}
?>
</nowiki></pre>

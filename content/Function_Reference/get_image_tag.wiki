== Description ==

An <img src /> tag for an image attachment, scaling it down if requested.

The filter 'get_image_tag_class' allows for changing the class name for the image without having to use regular expressions on the HTML content. The parameters are: what WordPress will use for the class, the Attachment ID, image align value, and the size the image should be.

The second filter 'get_image_tag' has the HTML content, which can then be further manipulated by a plugin to change all attribute values and even HTML content.

You'll need to manually supply the alt and title tags - to avoid having to do this, use [[Function_Reference/wp_get_attachment_image|wp_get_attachment_image]] instead.

== Usage ==

%%%<?php get_image_tag( $id, $alt, $title, $align, $size ); ?>%%%

== Parameters ==

{{Parameter|$id|int|Attachment ID.|required}}

{{Parameter|$alt|string|Image Description for the alt attribute.|required}}

{{Parameter|$title|string|Image Description for the title attribute.|required}}

{{Parameter|$align|string|Part of the class name for aligning the image.|required}}

{{Parameter|$size|string|Optional. Default is 'medium'.|optional|medium}}

== Return Values ==

{{Return||string|HTML IMG element for given image attachment}}

== Description ==
Retrieve attached file path based on attachment ID. 

You can optionally send it through the 'get_attached_file' filter, but by default it will just return the file path unfiltered. 

The function works by getting the single post meta name, named '<tt>_wp_attached_file</tt>' and returning it. This is a convenience function to prevent looking up the meta name and provide a mechanism for sending the attached file name through a filter. 

== Usage ==
%%%<?php get_attached_file( $attachment_id, $unfiltered ); ?>%%%

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$attachment_id|integer|Attachment ID.}}
{{Parameter|$unfiltered|boolean|Whether to apply filters or not.|optional|false}}

== Return Values ==
; <tt>(string)</tt> : The file path to the attached file.

== Examples ==
<!-- Need creative examples. Feel free to link to external examples. -->

 $fullsize_path = get_attached_file( $attachment_id ); // Full path

== Notes ==
* Uses: [[Function_Reference/apply_filters|<tt>apply_filters()</tt>]] to call [[Function_Reference/get_attached_file|<tt>get_attached_file()</tt>]] on file path and <tt>$attachment_id</tt>.
* Uses: [[Function_Reference/get_post_meta|<tt>get_post_meta()</tt>]] on <tt>$attachment_id</tt>, the '<tt>_wp_attached_file</tt>' meta name.

== Description ==
Creates the initial taxonomies. 

This function fires twice: in {{Trac|wp-settings.php}} before plugins are loaded (for backwards compatibility reasons), and again on the <tt>[[Plugin_API/Action_Reference/init|init]]</tt> action. We must avoid registering rewrite rules before the '<tt>init</tt>' action. 

== Usage ==
%%%<?php create_initial_taxonomies() ?>%%%

== Parameters ==
None.

== Return Values ==
; (void) : This function does not return a value.

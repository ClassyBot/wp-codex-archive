== Description ==
Appends a trailing slash.

Will remove trailing slash if it exists already before adding a trailing slash. This prevents double slashing a string or path.

The primary use of this is for paths and thus should be used for paths. It is not restricted to paths and offers no specific path support.

== Usage ==
%%%<?php trailingslashit( $string ) ?>%%%

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$string|string|What to add the trailing slash to.}}

== Return Values ==
; (string) : String with trailing slash added.

== Examples ==
<pre>
<?php
$path = trailingslashit( '/home/julien/bin/dotfiles' ); 
?>
</pre>
$path will now contain: %%%/home/julien/bin/dotfiles/%%%
(Notice the trailing slash)

== Notes ==
* Uses: [[Function_Reference/untrailingslashit|<tt>untrailingslashit()</tt>]] Unslashes string if it was slashed already.
* This: '<tt>/</tt>' is a slash.

== Change Log ==
Since: 1.2.0

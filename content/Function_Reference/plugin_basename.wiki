== Description ==

== Usage ==

%%% <?php plugin_basename( $file ); ?> %%%

== Parameters ==

{{Parameter|$file|string|Absolute path to a plugin file or directory within the plugins directory.}}

== Return ==

{{Return||string| Path to a plugin file or directory, relative to the plugins directory (without the leading and trailing slashes).}}

== Example ==

If your plugin file is located at ''/home/www/wp-content/plugins/<b>my-plugin/my-plugin.php</b>'', and you call:
 $x = plugin_basename( __FILE__ );
The <tt>$x</tt> variable will equal to "''<b>my-plugin/my-plugin.php</b>''".

== Notes ==

* Uses both the <tt>WP_PLUGIN_DIR</tt> and <tt>WPMU_PLUGIN_DIR</tt> constants internally, to test for and strip the plugins directory path from the <tt>$file</tt> path. Note that the direct usage of WordPress internal constants [[Determining Plugin and Content Directories|is not recommended]].

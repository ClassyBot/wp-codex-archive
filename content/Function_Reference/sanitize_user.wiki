== Description ==
Sanitize username stripping out unsafe characters.

If <tt>$strict</tt> is true, only alphanumeric characters plus these: <tt>_</tt>, space, <tt>.</tt>, <tt>-</tt>, <tt>*</tt>, and <tt>@</tt> are returned.

Removes tags, octets, entities, and if strict is enabled, will remove all non-[[wikipedia:ASCII|ASCII]] characters. After sanitizing, it passes the username, raw username (the username in the parameter), and the strict parameter as parameters for the [[Plugin API/Filter Reference/sanitize_user|sanitize_user]] filter.

== Usage ==
%%%<?php sanitize_user( $username, $strict ) ?>%%%

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$username|string|The username to be sanitized.}}
{{Parameter|$strict|boolean|If set limits <tt>$username</tt> to specific characters.|optional|false}}

== Return Values ==
; (string) : The sanitized username, after passing through filters.

== Description ==
Sanitize string from bad protocols.

This function removes all non-allowed protocols from the beginning of <tt>$string</tt>. It ignores whitespace and the case of the letters, and it does understand [[wikipedia:HTML|HTML]] entities. It does its work in a while loop, so it won't be fooled by a string like '<tt>javascript:javascript:alert(57)</tt>'.

== Usage ==
%%%<?php wp_kses_bad_protocol( $string, $allowed_protocols ); ?>%%%

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$string|string|Content to filter bad protocols from}}
{{Parameter|$allowed_protocols|array|Allowed protocols to keep}}

== Return Values ==
; (string) : Filtered content

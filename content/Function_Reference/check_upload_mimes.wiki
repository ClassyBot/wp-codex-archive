== Description ==
Check an array of [[Glossary#MIME|MIME]] types against a whitelist. All types not on the whitelist are filtered out, and only the allowed types are returned.

WordPress ships with a set of allowed upload file types, which is defined in {{Trac|wp-includes/functions.php}} in <tt>[[Function_Reference/get_allowed_mime_types | get_allowed_mime_types()]]</tt>. This function is used to filter that list against the filetype whitelist provided by Multisite Super Admins at wp-admin/network/settings.php.

== Usage ==
%%%<?php check_upload_mimes( $mimes ) ?>%%%
== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$mimes|array|MIME types to check.|required}}

== Return Value ==
{{Return||array|Allowed types in <tt>$mimes</tt>.}}

== Examples ==
<pre>
<?php

$mimes = array(
        'jpg|jpeg|jpe' => 'image/jpeg',
        'php'          => 'application/x-php', // This isn't on the whitelist!
);

$mimes = check_upload_mimes( $mimes );

// array( 'jpg|jpeg|jpe' => 'image/jpeg' );

?>
</pre>

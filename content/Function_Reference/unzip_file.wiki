== Description ==

Unzips a specified ZIP file to a location on the Filesystem via the WordPress Filesystem Abstraction. Assumes that WP_Filesystem() has already been called and set up. Does not extract a root-level __MACOSX directory, if present.

Attempts to increase the PHP Memory limit to 256M before uncompressing. However, the most memory required shouldn't be much larger than the Archive itself.

         echo 'There was an error unzipping the file.';

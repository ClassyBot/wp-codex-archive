== Description ==

Essentially the same as [[Function_Reference/set_transient | set_transient()]] but works network wide when using WP Multisite.

One difference is that the transient name should be [https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/40432 167 characters or less in length].  Also, while [[Function_Reference/set_transient | set_transient()]] sets transients that have an expiration time to not autoload, all transients added with `set_site_transient` will auto-load at all times.

NB: this won't work for websites behind some load balancers, especially Network Solutions hosted websites. To bodgy up a fix, save [https://gist.github.com/webaware/4688802 this gist] into the plugins folder and enable it. For details, read [http://snippets.webaware.com.au/snippets/wordpress-is_ssl-doesnt-work-behind-some-load-balancers/ WordPress is_ssl() doesn’t work behind some load balancers].

Websites behind load balancers or reverse proxies that support HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO can be fixed by adding the following code to the wp-config.php file, above the require_once call:

 if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO']) && $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO'] == 'https')
     $_SERVER['HTTPS'] = 'on';

== Description ==

Checks an email address against a list of banned domains.

This function checks against the Banned Email Domains list at wp-admin/network/settings.php. The check is only run on self-registrations; user creation at wp-admin/network/users.php bypasses this check.

As of [[Version_3.5|3.5]], this function was made marginally less aggressive due to legitimate domains matching as partials of banned domains or sub-domains of banned domains.

== Usage ==

%%%<?php is_email_address_unsafe( $user_email ); ?>%%%

== Parameters ==

{{Parameter|$user_email|string|The email provided by the user at registration.|required}}

== Return Values ==

{{Return||bool|Returns true when the email address is banned.}}

== Source File ==

== Changelog ==
* [[Version_3.5|3.5.0]]: Made less aggressive toward legitimate domains partially matching against banned ones.
* Since: WPMU

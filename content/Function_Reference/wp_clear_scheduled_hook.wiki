== Description ==

Un-schedules all previously-scheduled cron jobs using a particular hook name or a specific combination of hook name and arguments.

== Usage ==
%%% <?php wp_clear_scheduled_hook( $hook, $args ); ?> %%%

== Parameters ==

{{Parameter|$hook|string|The name of an action hook to execute.}}
{{Parameter|$args|array|Arguments to pass to the hook function(s)|optional}}

== Return Value ==
No value is returned by this function.

== Examples ==

=== Clear a scheduled event ===

<pre>
// If you previously added for example
// wp_schedule_single_event( time() + 3600, 'my_new_event' );

wp_clear_scheduled_hook( 'my_new_event' );

// or this if you created something like
// wp_schedule_single_event( time() + 3600, 'my_new_event', array( 'some_arg' ) );

wp_clear_scheduled_hook( 'my_new_event', array( 'some_arg' ) );
</pre>

== Notes ==
If you created a scheduled job using a hook and arguments you cannot delete it by supplying only the hook. Similarly if you created a set of scheduled jobs that share a hook but have different arguments you cannot delete them using only the hook name, you have to delete them all individually using the hook name and arguments.

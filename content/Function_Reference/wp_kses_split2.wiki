== Description ==
Callback for [[Function_Reference/wp_kses_split|<tt>wp_kses_split()</tt>]] for fixing malformed HTML tags.

This function does a lot of work. It rejects some very malformed things like <tt><nowiki><:::></nowiki></tt>. It returns an empty string, if the element isn't allowed (look ma, no <tt>strip_tags()</tt>!). Otherwise it splits the tag into an element and an attribute list.

After the tag is split into an element and an attribute list, it is run through another filter which will remove illegal attributes and once that is completed, will be returned.

== Usage ==
%%%<?php wp_kses_split2( $string, $allowed_html, $allowed_protocols ) ?>%%%

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$string|string|Content to filter}}
{{Parameter|$allowed_html|array|Allowed HTML elements}}
{{Parameter|$allowed_protocols|array|Allowed protocols to keep}}

== Return Values ==
; (string) : Fixed HTML element

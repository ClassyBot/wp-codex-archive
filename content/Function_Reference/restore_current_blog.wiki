== Description ==

Restore the current blog, after calling <tt>[[Function_Reference/switch_to_blog|switch_to_blog()]]</tt>.

== Usage ==
%%%<?php restore_current_blog() ?>%%%
== Parameters ==
This function does not accept any parameters

== Return Values ==

{{Return||boolean|True on success, False if we're already on the current blog}}

== Examples ==
<pre>
switch_to_blog( 5 );

/* Do stuff */

restore_current_blog();
</pre>

== Notes ==

<tt>restore_current_blog()</tt> should be called after every <tt>[[Function_Reference/switch_to_blog | switch_to_blog()]]</tt>. If not, a global variable which monitors the switching, <tt>$GLOBALS['_wp_switched_stack']</tt>, will not be empty even if you use <tt>switch_to_blog()</tt> to return to the original blog.  If <tt>$GLOBALS['_wp_switched_stack']</tt> is not empty, WP will think it is in a switched state and can potentially return the wrong URL for the site via [[Function_Reference/wp_upload_dir|wp_upload_dir()]]. See http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/a/123516/27757

When calling <tt>switch_to_blog()</tt> repeatedly, either call <tt>restore_current_blog()</tt> each time, or save the original blog ID until the end and call <tt>switch_to_blog()</tt> with that <em>and</em> do:

 $GLOBALS['_wp_switched_stack'] = array();
 $GLOBALS['switched'] = false;

The former is probably preferable, as it is not a hack.

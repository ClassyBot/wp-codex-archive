==Description==
This function will check whether or not a given email address (<tt>$email</tt>) has already been registered to a username, and returns that users ID (or <tt>false</tt> if none exists). See also [[Function Reference/username exists|username_exists]].

This function is normally used when a user is registering, to ensure that the E-mail address the user is attempting to register with has not already been registered.

== Usage ==
%%%<?php
if ( email_exists( $email ) ) {
	// Stuff to do when email address exists
}
?>%%%

== Parameter ==

{{Parameter|$email|string|The E-mail address to check|required}}

== Return ==

* If the E-mail exists, function returns the ID of the user to whom the E-mail is registered.
* If the E-mail does not exist, function returns <tt>false</tt>.

== Examples ==
If the E-mail exists, echo the ID number to which the E-mail is registered. Otherwise, tell the viewer that it does not exist.
%%%<?php
$email = 'myemail@example.com';
$exists = email_exists( $email );
if ( $exists ) {
	echo 'That E-mail is registered to user number ' . esc_html( $exists );
} else {
	echo 'That E-mail doesn\'t belong to any registered users on this site';
}
?>%%%

== Description ==

Displays the name of a category if it's different from the previous category. This tag must be used within [[The Loop]].

== Replace With ==

This tag was deprecated when multiple categories were added to WordPress, and there is no one-to-one correspondence with another tag. 

To display the name of the category when on a category page, use:

 <?php echo get_the_category_by_ID($cat); ?>

To display category name(s) on a single post page, this code (which would need to run in [[The Loop]]) provides an example:

 <?php
 foreach(get_the_category() as $category) {
     echo $category->cat_name . ' '; 
 }
 ?>

== Usage ==

%%% <?php the_category_head( $before, $after ); ?> %%%

== Parameters ==

; before : (''string'') Text to output before the category. Defaults to <tt>&#39;&#39;</tt> (no text).
; after : (''string'') Text to output after the category. Defaults to <tt>&#39;&#39;</tt> (no text).

== Example ==

Displays the text "'''Category: '''" followed by the name of the category.

 &lt;h2&gt;<?php the_category_head('Category: '); ?>&lt;/h2&gt;

== Change Log ==

* Since: 0.71
* Deprecated: 0.71?
* Replace By: [[Template Tags/get_the_category_by_ID]]

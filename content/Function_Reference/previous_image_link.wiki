%%%<?php previous_image_link( $size, $text ); ?>%%%

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$size|string|Size of image, either array or string. <tt>0</tt> or <tt>none</tt> will default to <tt>post_title</tt> or <tt>$text</tt>.|optional|thumbnail}}

{{Parameter|$text|string|If included, link will reflect <tt>$text</tt> variable.|optional|false}}

== Examples ==

===Default Usage===
 <?php previous_image_link(); ?>

=== Working example ===
<pre>
<div class="alignleft"><?php previous_image_link(); ?></div>
</pre>

=== Choose a Recognized Image Size ===
<pre>
<?php previous_image_link( 'thumbnail' ); ?>
<?php previous_image_link( 'medium' ); ?>
<?php previous_image_link( 'large' ); ?>
<?php previous_image_link( 'fullsize' ); ?>
</pre>

=== Define a Custom Image Size ===
 <?php previous_image_link( array( 37, 37 ) ); ?>
Please note that passing an array as the first parameter will not create a new image; It will use the web browser to re-size the thumbnail to fit into the given dimensions. Although this works in a pinch, it produces a rather distorted view of the image due to the fact that browsers have no way of re sampling the re-sized image.

=== Use the Image’s Title as Link Text ===
If a Boolean false is used as the first parameter, The function will use the image’s title value (as set through the Media Library).
<pre>
<?php previous_image_link( false ); ?>
<?php previous_image_link( 0 ); ?>
</pre>

=== Use a Custom String as Link Text ===
To specify a custom string as the link text, pass a Boolean false as the first parameter and the custom text as a string to the second parameter.
 <?php previous_image_link( false, 'Previous Image' ); ?>

== Change Log ==
*Since: 2.5.0
*2.8 added 2 parameters: $size and $text

== Description ==
Convert all entities to their character counterparts. 

This function decodes numeric [[wikipedia:HTML_entities|HTML entities]] (like <tt>&amp;#65;</tt> and <tt>&amp;#x41;</tt>). It doesn't do anything with other entities like <tt>&amp;auml;</tt>, but we don't need them in the URL protocol whitelisting system anyway. 

== Usage ==
%%%<?php wp_kses_decode_entities( $string ) ?>%%%

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$string|string|Content to change entities}}

== Return Values ==
; (string) : Content after decoded entities

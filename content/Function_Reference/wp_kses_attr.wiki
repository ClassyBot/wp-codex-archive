== Description ==
Removes all attributes, if none are allowed for this element. 

If some are allowed it calls [[Function_Reference/wp_kses_hair|<tt>wp_kses_hair()</tt>]] to split them further, and then it builds up new [[wikipedia:HTML|HTML]] code from the data that [[Function_Reference/wp_kses_hair|<tt>wp_kses_hair()</tt>]] returns. It also removes '<tt>&lt;</tt>' and '<tt>&gt;</tt>' characters, if there are any left. One more thing it does is to check if the tag has a closing XHTML slash, and if it does, it puts one in the returned code as well.

== Usage ==
%%%<?php wp_kses_attr( $element, $attr, $allowed_html, $allowed_protocols ) ?>%%%

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$element|string|[[wikipedia:HTML|HTML]] element/tag}}
{{Parameter|$attr|string|[[wikipedia:HTML|HTML]] attributes from HTML element to closing HTML element tag}}
{{Parameter|$allowed_html|array|Allowed [[wikipedia:HTML|HTML]] elements}}
{{Parameter|$allowed_protocols|array|Allowed protocols to keep}}

== Return Values ==
; (string) : Sanitized [[wikipedia:HTML|HTML]] element

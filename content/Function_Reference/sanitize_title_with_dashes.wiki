== Description ==
Sanitizes title, replacing whitespace with dashes.

Limits the output to alphanumeric characters, underscore (<tt>_</tt>) and dash (<tt>-</tt>). Whitespace becomes a dash.

Note that <b>it does not replace special accented characters</b> (see plugins such as [https://github.com/toscho/Germanix-WordPress-Plugin] to fix that).

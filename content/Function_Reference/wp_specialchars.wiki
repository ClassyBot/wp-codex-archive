== Description ==
'''This function is deprecated as of WordPress 2.8.0. Please use [[Function Reference/esc_html|esc_html]] instead.'''

Converts a number of special characters into their HTML entities.

Differs from [http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.htmlspecialchars.php <tt>htmlspecialchars</tt>] as existing HTML entities will not be encoded. Specifically changes: <tt>&amp;</tt> to <tt>&amp;#038;</tt>, <tt>&lt;</tt> to <tt>&amp;lt;</tt> and <tt>&gt;</tt> to <tt>&amp;gt;</tt>.

<tt>$quotes</tt> can be set to '<tt>single</tt>' to encode <tt>'</tt> to <tt>&amp;#039;</tt>, '<tt>double</tt>' to encode <tt>"</tt> to <tt>&amp;quot;</tt>, or '<tt>1</tt>' to do both. Default is <tt>0</tt> where no quotes are encoded.

== Usage ==
%%%<?php wp_specialchars( $text, $quotes ) ?>%%%

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$text|string|The text which is to be encoded.}}
{{Parameter|$quotes|mixed|Converts single quotes if set to '<tt>single</tt>', double if set to '<tt>double</tt>' or both if otherwise set.|optional|0}}

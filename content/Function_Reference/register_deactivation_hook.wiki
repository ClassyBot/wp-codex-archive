== Description ==

The function '''register_deactivation_hook''' (introduced in WordPress 2.0) registers a plugin function to be run when the plugin is deactivated.

When a plugin is deactivated, the action 'deactivate_PLUGINNAME' hook is called. In the name of this hook, PLUGINNAME is replaced with the name of the plugin, including the optional subdirectory. For example, when the plugin is located in wp-content/plugin/sampleplugin/sample.php, then the name of this hook will become 'deactivate_sampleplugin/sample.php'. When the plugin consists of only one file and is (as by default) located at wp-content/plugin/sample.php the name of this hook will be 'deactivate_sample.php'.

This function is a wrapper for the 'deactivate_PLUGINNAME' action, and is easier to use.

== Usage ==

%%% <?php register_deactivation_hook($file, $function); ?> %%%

== Parameters ==

{{Parameter|$file|string|Path to the [[Writing_a_Plugin#Plugin_Files|main plugin file]] inside the <tt>wp-content/plugins</tt> directory. A full path will work.}}

{{Parameter|$function|callback|The function to be run when the plugin is deactivated. Any of [http://us2.php.net/manual/en/language.pseudo-types.php#language.types.callback PHP's callback pseudo-types] will work.}}

== Examples ==

If you have a function called <tt>myplugin_deactivate()</tt> in the [[Writing_a_Plugin#Plugin_Files|main plugin file]] at either 
*	<tt>wp-content/plugins/<var>myplugin</var>.php</tt> or
*	<tt>wp-content/plugins/<var>myplugin</var>/<var>myplugin</var>.php</tt>
use this code:
 register_deactivation_hook( __FILE__, 'myplugin_deactivate' );

This will call the <tt>myplugin_deactivate()</tt> function on deactivation of the plugin.

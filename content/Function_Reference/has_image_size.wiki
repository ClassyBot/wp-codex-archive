==Description==
Checks if an image size name has been registered using [[Function_Reference/add_image_size|add_image_size()]]. This is a boolean function, meaning it returns either TRUE or FALSE.

Since it only checks for image sizes that are registered via add_image_size() function, core image sizes namely small, medium, medium_large and large will not be considered. Hence, checking for a core image size using has_image_size() will always return FALSE.

==Usage==
%%%<?php has_image_size($name); ?>%%%

==Return Values==
; <tt>(boolean)</tt> : <tt>true</tt> on success, <tt>false</tt> on failure.

==Parameters==
{{Parameter|$name|string|The registered image size name to check for.}}

==Examples==
In a theme's functions.php file combined with <tt>remove_image_size()</tt>:

<pre>
add_action('after_setup_theme', 'remove_registered_image_size');

function remove_registered_image_size() {
	if(has_image_size('image-name')) {
		remove_image_size('image-name');
	}
}
</pre>

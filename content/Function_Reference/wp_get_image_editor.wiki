== Description ==
This function is the main function that you use when you want to get a reference to an image, to edit a local image on the server. It returns a [[Class_Reference/WP_Image_Editor|WP_Image_Editor]] instance and loads a file into it. With that you can manipulate an image by calling methods on it. For more information see: [[Class_Reference/WP_Image_Editor|WP_Image_Editor]]. Keep in mind that the GD library needs to be installed and active on your server to use the full range of the image editor features.

{{Parameter|$path|string|Path to file to load. The path parameter should be a local file (such as /var/www/wordpress/some/directory/image). In some cases using a url as the parameter will work, but depending on the server setup and firewalls, fetching the url of the image may or may not work!!}}

== Description ==

Switch the current blog to a different blog.  <tt>[[Function_Reference/switch_to_blog|switch_to_blog()]]</tt> is useful if you need to pull posts or other information
from other blogs.

You can switch back afterwards using <tt>[[Function_Reference/restore_current_blog|restore_current_blog()]]</tt>. Note that this function reverses only the last blog switching action, typically the most recent call to <tt>switch_to_blog()</tt>. See the example below on how to proceed when multiple <tt>switch_to_blog()</tt>s are used.

Things that aren't switched:
* autoloaded options. See #[http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14992 14992]
* plugins. See #[http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14941 14941]
* [http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14992 the object cache]

== Parameters ==

{{Parameter|$new_blog|integer|The id of the blog you want to switch to.|required|current blog}}

{{Parameter|$deprecated|boolean|Deprecated argument|optional|null}}

== Return Values ==

{{Return||bool|<tt>true</tt> is returned even when no blog exists with a Blog ID of <tt>$new_blog</tt>, or when "switching" to the current blog.}}

== Examples ==

==== One switch ====
<pre>
switch_to_blog( $blog_id );
// Do something
restore_current_blog();
</pre>

==== Multiple switches ====
<pre>
$blog_ids=get_sites();
foreach( $blog_ids as $b ){
    switch_to_blog( $b->blog_id );
    //Do stuff
    restore_current_blog();
}
</pre>
If you do not call <tt>restore_current_blog()</tt> after every <tt>switch_to_blog()</tt>, WordPress can get into a state that can potentially build the wrong urls for the site.

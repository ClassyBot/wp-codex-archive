== Description ==
Retrieve path of [[Templates|attachment template]] in current or parent template.

The attachment path first checks if the first part of the mime type exists. The second check is for the second part of the mime type. The last check is for both types separated by an underscore. If neither are found then the file <tt>'attachment.php'</tt> is checked and returned.

Some examples for the <tt>'text/plain'</tt> mime type are <tt>'text.php'</tt>, <tt>'plain.php'</tt>, and finally <tt>'text_plain.php'</tt>.

== Description ==
Updates the comment count for post(s). 

When <tt>$do_deferred</tt> is <tt>false</tt> (is by default) and the comments have been set to be deferred, <tt>$post_id</tt> will be added to a queue, which will be updated at a later date and only updated once per post ID. 

If the comments have not be set up to be deferred, then the post will be updated. When <tt>$do_deferred</tt> is set to true, then all previous deferred post IDs will be updated along with the current <tt>$post_id</tt>.

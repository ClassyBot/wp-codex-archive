== Description ==

Retrieve the numeric ID of the current post. This tag must be within [[The Loop]].

== Usage ==

%%% <?php get_the_ID(); ?> %%%

== Parameters ==

This tag has no parameters.

== Returns ==
{{Return|ID|int|The ID of the current post.}}

== Examples ==

=== Store the ID ===

The ID can be stored as a variable using
%%% <?php $postid = get_the_ID(); ?> %%%

=== Post Anchor Identifier ===

<tt>get_the_ID()</tt> Can be used to provide a unique anchor in a script. For instance, a dynamically-generated drop down menu with actions for each post in an archive could have

<pre><?php
$id = get_the_ID();
$dropdown = "<select name='dropdown-".$id."' >";
$dropdown .= "<option id='option1-". $id ."'>Option 1</option>";
$dropdown .= "</select>";
?></pre>

This would allow us to use JavaScript to control the element as it has a unique ID, and when submitting it as a form through the POST or GET methods the dropdown box will be sent with a unique ID which allows the script to note which post it is working on. Alternatively a hidden variable could be sent which will allow the script to see which post the submission is referring to

<pre><?php
echo '<input type="hidden" name="activepost" id="activepost" value="'.get_the_ID().'" />';
?></pre>

If the ID is not called within the_loop, then we can use [[Template Tags/the_ID|<tt>the_ID</tt>]] rather than <tt>echo get_the_ID();</tt>

==Change Log==

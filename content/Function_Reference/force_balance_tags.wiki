== Description ==
Balances tags of string using a modified stack. 

Ignores the '<tt>use_balanceTags</tt>' option. 

== Usage ==
%%%<?php force_balance_tags( $text ) ?>%%%

This function is used in the short post excerpt list, to prevent unmatched elements.
For example, it makes 
%%%<div><b>This is an excerpt. <!--more--> and this is more text... </b></div>%%%
not break, when the html after the more tag is cut off.

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$text|string|Text to be balanced.}}

== Return Values ==
; (string) : Balanced text.

== Examples ==
In the example above, 
%%%<div><b>This is an excerpt. %%%
should be changed to:
%%%<div><b>This is an excerpt. </b></div>%%%
by the force_balance_tags function.

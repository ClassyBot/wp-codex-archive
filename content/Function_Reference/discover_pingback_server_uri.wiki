== Description ==
Finds a pingback server URI based on the given URL. 

Checks the xhtml for the <tt>rel="pingback"</tt> link and x-pingback headers. It does a check for the x-pingback headers first and returns that, if available. The check for the <tt>rel="pingback"</tt> has more overhead than just the header. 

== Usage ==
%%%<?php discover_pingback_server_uri( $url, $deprecated ) ?>%%%

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$url|string|URL to ping.}}
{{Parameter|$deprecated|integer||Not Used.}}

== Return Values ==
; <tt>(boolean&#124;string)</tt> : False on failure, string containing URI on success.

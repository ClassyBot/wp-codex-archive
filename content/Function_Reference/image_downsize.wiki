== Description ==

Scale an image to fit a particular size (such as <code>'thumb'</code> or <code>'medium'</code>).  

The <code>$max_/$min_width</code> for the [[Function_Reference/add_image_size#Reserved_Image_Size_Names|Reserved Names]] will always be what you defined under "admin UI" » "Settings" » "Media". For detail, please refer to [[Function_Reference/image_constrain_size_for_editor#Description|image_constrain_size_for_editor()]].

The URL might be the original image, or it might be a resized version. <b>This function won't create a new resized copy</b>, it will just return an already resized one if it exists.

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$id|integer|The ID of the image.}}
{{Parameter|$size|string|Size of image. It can be <tt> thumbnail </tt> or <tt> medium </tt>.|optional|medium}}

== Return Values ==

{{Return||boolean&#124;array|<tt>False</tt> on failure, array on success.  Array with image url, width, height, and whether is intermediate size (<tt>$is_intermediate</tt>), in that order is returned on success is returned.  <tt>$is_intermediate</tt> is <tt>true</tt> if <tt>$url</tt> is a resized image, false if it is the original.}}

== Source File ==

<tt>image_downsize()</tt> is located in {{Trac|wp-includes/media.php}}.

== Examples ==


=== Add a function to select medium attachment images ===

Maybe you already know <tt>wp_get_attachment_thumb_url();</tt>. Now I'm showing how to do the same thing to return the url for the medium sized attachment. 
<pre>
function wp_get_attachment_medium_url( $id )
{
    $medium_array = image_downsize( $id, 'medium' );
    $medium_path = $medium_array[0];

    return $medium_path;
}
</pre>

<tt>$id</tt> is the ID of the attachment

This can be really useful for plugins like WP-Choose-Thumb. With this function you can get the medium sized previews.

== Description ==

Determine if a script has been registered, enqueued, printed, or is waiting to be printed. Very useful when registering/enqueing scripts in plugins to avoid conflicts with other plugin scripts.

== Usage ==

%%%<?php wp_script_is( $handle, $list = 'enqueued' ); ?>%%%

== Parameters ==

{{Parameter|$handle|string|Name of the script. Lowercase string.}}

{{Parameter|$list|string|The list to query.
::* '''registered''' - script was registered through [[Function Reference/wp_register_script|wp_register_script()]]
::* '''enqueued''' / '''queue''' - script was enqueued
::* '''done''' - script has been printed
::* '''to_do''' - script has not yet been printed
|optional|enqueued}}

== Return Values ==

; (bool) : True or false.

== Example ==

    $handle = 'fluidVids.js';
    $list = 'enqueued';
      if (wp_script_is( $handle, $list )) {
        return;
      } else {
        wp_register_script( 'fluidVids.js', plugin_dir_url(__FILE__).'js/fluidvids.min.js');
        wp_enqueue_script( 'fluidVids.js' );
      }

This would check if the script named 'fluidVids.js' is enqueued. If it is enqueued, it does nothing. If it is not enqueued, the files are then registered and enqueued.

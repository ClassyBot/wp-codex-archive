== Description ==
Add a new user to a blog by visiting <tt>/newbloguser/username/</tt>.

The details must at least contain values for the following keys:
* <tt>$details['user_id']</tt> - (integer) the ID of the user being added to the blog
* <tt>$details['role']</tt> - (string) the role to be assigned to the user in the blog

== Description ==

Attempts to determine the real file type of a file.<br>
If unable to, the file name extension will be used to determine type.
If it's determined that the extension does not match the file's real type,
then the "proper_filename" value will be set with a proper filename and extension.

== Usage ==
%%%<?php
$validate = wp_check_filetype_and_ext( $file, $filename, $mimes );

if( $validate['proper_filename'] !== false )
    $filename = $validate['proper_filename'];
?>%%%

== Parameters ==

{{Parameter|$file|string|Full path to the image.|required}}
{{Parameter|$filename|string|The filename of the image (may differ from $file due to $file being in a tmp directory)|required}}
{{Parameter|$mimes|array|Array of $key = $value pairs with the keys being the file extension and values being the mime type.|optional|null}}

== Return Values ==
; (array) : Values for the extension, MIME, and either a corrected filename or false if original $filename is valid
* ['ext'] - Extension (eg 'jpg')
* ['type'] - Mime Type (eg 'image/jpeg')
* ['proper_filename'] - (''[[How to Pass Tag Parameters#boolean|boolean]]''<nowiki />) false or a string containing a proper file name if the original was invalid.

== Examples ==
<!-- Need creative examples. Feel free to link to external examples. -->

== Notes ==
Currently this function only supports validating images known to getimagesize().

If using in a plugin/theme and you get an error about this function not being defined, you probably need to add <tt>require_once ABSPATH .'wp-admin/includes/file.php';</tt> before the function gets called.

== Change Log ==
Since: 3.0.0

== Description ==
Sanitizes a filename replacing whitespace with dashes

Removes special characters that are illegal in filenames on certain operating systems and special characters requiring special escaping to manipulate at the command line. Replaces spaces and consecutive dashes with a single dash. Trim period, dash and underscore from beginning and end of filename.

The special  characters are passed through the [[Plugin API/Filter Reference/sanitize_file_name_chars|sanitize_file_name_chars]] filter before removing them from the file name, allowing plugins to change which characters are considered invalid. After <code>sanitize_file_name()</code> has done its work, it passes the sanitized file name through the [[Plugin API/Filter Reference/sanitize_file_name|sanitize_file_name]] filter.

== Usage ==
%%%<?php sanitize_file_name( $name ) ?>%%%

== Parameters ==
{{Parameter|$name|string|The file name}}

== Return Values ==
; (string) : Sanitized file name

{{#dotorgredirect:https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_remote_request/}}

== Description ==

Retrieve the raw response from the HTTP request.

The array structure is a little complex.

<pre>
$res = array(
    'headers'  => array(),

    'response' => array(
        'code'    => int,
        'message' => string
    )
);
</pre>


All of the headers in <code>$res['headers']</code> are with the name as the key and the
value as the value. So to get the User-Agent, you would do the following.

<pre>$user_agent = $res['headers']['user-agent'];</pre>

The body is the raw response content and can be retrieved from <code>$res['body']</code>.
This function is called first to make the request and there are other API
functions to abstract out the above convoluted setup.

== Parameters ==

{{Parameter|$url|string|Site URL to retrieve.|required}}

{{Parameter|$args|array|Optional. Override the defaults.|optional|Array}}

== Return Values ==

{{Return||WP_Error|array|The response or WP_Error on failure.}}

== Change Log ==

Since: [[Version 2.7.0|2.7.0]]

== Source File ==

wp_remote_request() is located in {{Trac|wp-includes/http.php}}

== Notes ==
* Uses the <tt>[[Plugin_API/Action_Reference/add_user_to_blog | 'add_user_to_blog']]</tt> action to fire an event when users are added to a blog.
* It does not check if the user is already a member of the blog before setting their role. If you don't want to overwrite the role of a user if they are already a member of the blog, use <tt>[[Function_Reference/is_user_member_of_blog | is_user_member_of_blog()]]</tt> to check that first.
* You ''do not'' need to call <tt>[[Function_Reference/switch_to_blog | switch_to_blog()]]</tt> to switch to the blog you want to add the user to before calling this function. The function will switch to the blog itself, and restore the current blog before returning as well.

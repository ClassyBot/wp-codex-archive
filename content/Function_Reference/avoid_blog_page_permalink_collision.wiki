== Description ==

This function is applied to the filter <tt>[[Plugin API/Filter Reference/wp insert post data | 'wp_insert_post_data']]</tt>. On subdirectory multisite installs, it filters Pages' <tt>'post_name'</tt> (URL slug) field to ensure that there is no conflict with any of the subdirectory links.

== Example ==

If you have a one of your sites set up on a sub-directory <tt>'my-site'</tt>, and then publish a page on your main site titled "My Site", the slug would by default be <tt>'my-site'</tt>. So the URL of the site on your network would be <nowiki>http://www.example.com/my-site/</nowiki>, but that would also be the URL of that page. The <tt>avoid_blog_page_permalink_collision()</tt> function fixes this conflict by appending a random string to the page's slug.

== Change Log ==

* Since [[Version 3.0 | 3.0.0]]

== Source File ==
<tt>avoid_blog_page_permalink_collision()</tt> is located in {{Trac|wp-admin/includes/ms.php}}.

== Description ==

Checks if a plugin is not activated.

This function is the logical negation of [[Function_Reference/is_plugin_active|<code>is_plugin_active()</code>]]. Used as a callback.

== Usage ==

In the Admin Area:
%%%<?php is_plugin_inactive($plugin) ?>%%%
In the front end, in a theme, etc...
%%%<?php include_once( ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/plugin.php' ); ?>
<?php is_plugin_inactive($plugin) ?>%%%

== Parameters ==

{{Parameter|$plugin|string|The name of the plugin sub-directory/file.}}

== Return Values ==

;True:if plugin is not activated, else <tt>false</tt>.

== Examples ==

%%%<?php
// Makes sure the plugin is defined before trying to use it
if ( ! function_exists('is_plugin_inactive')) {
    require_once( ABSPATH . '/wp-admin/includes/plugin.php' );
}

if (is_plugin_inactive('plugin-directory/plugin-file.php')) {
    //plugin is not activated
}
?>%%%

== Notes ==

The file that defines this function (wp-admin/includes/plugin.php) is only loaded in the admin sections. In order to use is_plugin_active outside the admin pages, it's necessary to include or require plugin.php before trying to use it (as shown in the example).

== Change Log ==

Since [[Version 3.1]]

== Source File ==

<code>is_plugin_inactive()</code> is defined in {{Trac|wp-admin/includes/plugin.php}}.

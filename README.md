# WP Codex Archive

## What?

This is an archive of the MediaWiki markup and the resulting HTML from all
(most) pages of https://codex.wordpress.org/.

## Why?

The WP documentation team plans to scrap the codex, but there is a lot of
information there with no clear replacement.  For example:

- https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query
- https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference
